It's weird that so many people talk about how good it looks and all that but doesn't talk about how the detective part is played for you, you can just click anywhere and the mystery solves itself even when Saga has no leads or ideas on what to do. Like she just knows things to move the plot. And Alan Wake's part are all flashbacks for some reason so it feels like he is a secondary character in his own game. And that's not even talking about how Saga actually swapped races in universe. The first time she is shown she is white and blonde and now she is black. Like what kind of supernatural powers does she have? Is Saga actually a skin walker? Because she actually changed skins and nobody even thinks twice. I love the game, don't get me wrong. I played and enjoyed every single game from these devs but this is really stretching with all the hand holding and just awful mystery solving on Saga's part. Give us something to work with please Remedy, because Saga is just either overpowered or poorly written and both sides are not good.",2024-06-05T12:38:12Z,2,3

It was the most fascinating narrative/horror/survival/shooter game I've played. Then, I played American Nightmare and was quite disappointed that it was just a filler. Years later, I got my hands on Control. I didn't know it was made by the Remedy until through gameplay I started to see some similarities such as the taken in perspective. Sadly, I shrugged it off and then AW2 was announced and I was thrilled. Bought it and started playing it enjoying every piece of art. Then Ahti appeared and my reaction wasn't recorded but I was beyond surprised and shocked. I knew they had a connection now.

Controls: Easy and familiar

I rarely get to enjoy a game such as this. Skull and Bones can be thrown into the trash. This is what paying customers want.

I will say In advance that I disagree in a way with the statement that it’s playable without playing the previous title. Sure, you absolutely can, but it does not hit the same way. My advice, take it or leave it, is to not only play Alan Wake and DLCs, but also play control and DLCs before jumping in. There are things in Alan wake 2 that are directly linked to both titles. Now, you can skip the Xbox exclusive which its name is escaping me at the moment, but I highly highly recommend playing the others. At the end of the day, Alan Wake 2 delivers some of the most creative story telling in the history of video games, absolutely captivating and addictive. The battle mechanics are well thought out and fluid . I did at times find the reload times difficult to navigate depending on the weapon.

The graphics are the best ever seen in a video game and this is in part due to remedies proprietary engine. Their engine is so effective and beautiful that I decided to purchase stock in remedy. I feel that at some point it could take podium where unreal engine has. All in all, if you are a fan of survival, horror, immersive, and disturbing atmospheres, unique, storylines, and are an open minded person, you might find this to be one of the best video games you’ve ever played.",2024-05-13T16:28:16Z,0,0

The only way I could do that is wander around the random location looking for a bubble. Once I looked at the bubble I could go to the writing room where I could type the story. But scratch didn’t like the story so I needed to find another plot device. But the apartment was a loop so I needed to come up with a different plot line. But the plot line had been erased so I needed to find my wife’s pictures and put them in a shoe box. But the shoe box had been re-written so i needed to write Saga into the story so she could provide me with a different index to my book to find the shoebox.

  Back in the late 90's and early 2000. If you bought a game for Pc before anyone you knew had it, it was a Gamble. Sometimes they would barley run on a new build and months later they would say ""Oooh yeah doesn't work on these GPU's and list a good amount of cards. You couldnt return the game either.

I will say, I really do think it's worth watching a AW1 and Control recap before jumping into 2 if you don't plan on playing them.",2024-03-07T04:02:33Z,0,0

Game crashed a few times in odd places about mid game which is frustrating and you need to remember to save when you can. I agree some of the dark place puzzles don't make sense and its hard to figure some of them out. Same with some 'boss' fights.

However, the combat is really quite bad (at least on console). The problem I have is that Saga's story is meant to be detective story, but there's absolutely nothing that the player really needs to do (the stringing clues together is basically automatic). These are NOT from the first 2-3 hours. A lot of the things discussed (especially with Wake) are much later in the game.",2024-02-02T10:37:05Z,0,0

Saga's mind place should be a little more automatized, since it adds little to the gameplay experience and in the end, just repeats what we see by playing the game. There's no feeling of satisfaction in 'deducting' the scenes, so it feels a little dull.
Combat is good in her parts, but Alan's chapters are kinda confusing. The whole 'scene change' gimmick didn't hit as good as Remedy expected to, leaving the player without knowing what plot should he use in each scene -- or if he should try every available plot in his disposal.
The ending is anti-climatic to say the least, and the real final boss fight is earlier in the game, since the ending is just more investigation and a final cutscene.
I'm leaning towards the thought that the story should've had a concrete ending, and leaving it open for a Part 3 doesn't seem very wise and not really honest toward an audience that already waited 13 years for the sequel.
I enjoyed for what it was, and there are plenty of good moments. A solid 7/10.",2024-01-15T12:43:13Z,0,0

Also, this is not just another horror game. This is an intelligemt game, with some very clever things going on. Imo this game is a masterpoece.

I've put 39 hours into the game (completed it) and it is a let down and disappointment to me: I'm tired of sugarcoating it or pretending it's not. Even though I didn't prefer Saga over Alan as a character (obviously, I'm playing a sequel to one of my favorite games and characters: Alan Wake), I too preferred Saga's sections because they were, well, better, as you detailed. Sigh. It's not that I disliked Saga or anything, it just seems crazy to me I estimate I played as much as 60-70% of Alan Wake 2 as Saga (AND importantly, Alan's sections were largely walking simulator). I honestly can't believe more people don't have a problem with this. I can't give the game more than a 6 or 7 out of 10 for these and other reasons: pacing, meh combat, amount of time walking/nothing happening. Ugh.",2023-11-24T15:15:14Z,0,2

Seems I've wasted my money on a top shelf 4K UHD monitor when so many new games now have you in the dark or showing grey tones.  Elden Ring got it right, balanced out with dark, spooky dungeons as well as open world daytime scenes with decent eye candy for visuals.  I'm a Souls-type player who occasionally takes a break from that genre.  But when I take a break, it's usually on excellent games from studios I know deliver quality, like Santa Monica Studio's gem, GOW Ragnarok.  The only Remedy game I remember playing was CONTROL, but it didn't hold me.  But yet, after watching this excellent, no-nonsense,  100% Grade A beef (no filler) reviewer, something is compelling me to throw coin at the studio to give this a shot. The last time I had that feeling was with Last Of Us, I at first considered to be a twink kinda game I wouldn't like and held off buying until I played through all my MUST HAVE games and found nothing decent on tap to buy afterwards.  I would then become an avid fan of the LOU series, ignoring the sucky battle mechanics to enjoy the ""can't wait to see what happens next"" storyline, like watching all seasons of ""24"" in spite of its incredulous, unrealistic plot details!!  So, here I am after completing Elden Ring, Wo Long Fallen Dynasty, Lords Of The Fallen and Lies Of P,  deciding if I want to get whiplash from the downshift to Alan Wake 2!""

Alan wake 2's gameplay and graphics are awesome, story took some interesting and twisting turns here and there, and most of the music is freaking awesome.
Loved the mix between Detective and Writer segments.
But i feel some things were off here and there.

Saga felt too ""perfect"" as a character.
She has a loving husband and child, she has a rising career without obstacles, she doesn't have any ""inner demons""/flaws, she is qualified to examine bodies classified as evidence and also repair out of the ordinary electronic stuff, and could get out of 'that place' she gets locked in without any help.
Alan has been locked in a similar place for years, without succes of escaping.
Could at least get some assist from her mother or grandfather.
Also annoyed they had to go with the 'a white man' near the end, instead of just 'some dumbass writer'. 
We learn she has some family stuff that she didn't know about,  but that doesn't really affect her as a character.
Alan got way too many items in contrast to Saga.
Had tons of health items as Alan, but just enough as Saga.
The buffs are locked for specific attributes, whice honestly kinda annoyed me.

Ending of game, there is no feeling of accomplishment, as your only left with questions, and no answers.
In first game alice gets freed by alan and he sacrifices his freedom for her's.
We don't get any accomplishment in this game.
Have a feeling we will see a DLC in the future, to tie up some loose ends.
The truth of 'the Cult of the tree' felt like a forced obstacle.
I preferred more how the flashlight was toggle controlled in the previous game as well.
First boss kinda felt like a fight from Dark souls, with terrible environment to dodge in.

On the PS5 version, there were a couple of bugs.
One or two required to load to fix it, and the last weapon case for Saga showed it was open, even though i hadn't solved it yet, as i tried to solve the lock, i was unsure if i had solved it and it was bugged, or i was just messing up.",2023-11-06T11:48:21Z,0,2

And the way certain characters react to certain things is just bland and emotionless. Not a huge fan of the girl protagonist. Now I haven’t finished it so only time will tell but as of now to me that’s what is holding this game back. But everything else is 10/10,2023-11-02T13:15:06Z,0,0

They are trying to weave a convoluted story between all their past games and while I appreciate them taking chances it doesn't necessarily work. I mean why use the FBI when the FBC exists and then ignore the FBC and make the FBI react the same as if they are the FBC? 😹😹😹 So dumb. If you're going to use the FBI in your story keep them grounded in reality instead of making them second rate X File protagonists.

Edit: after i played it for 2 hours (where saga meet alan) i think I'm not going to progress anymore, it's really really good i acknowledge that(graphic is the best I've ever saw, sounds design is top notch, story telling is unique (even though it's very confusing))but it's just not my cup of tea.

My biggest problems are the jumpscares and random flashing lights (I'm kinda sensitive to that), and also sometimes the game can get confusing for a moment because there's no real explanation of how the mechanics really work, maybe I'm just a coward but not everything should be good as we are different person, don't take my words seriously i think it's a game that everyone should experience at least once (if you can), but this is just not my type of game because i prefer games that could relaxed me not give me terror or nightmares",2023-10-28T14:53:19Z,0,0

The two chapters I just finished ended with completely optional but very well done music to listen to. Very good music for what I believe was just made for this game. The atmosphere, mystery and minimal combat I’ve done so far have all been top notch. Also, the fact that this game basically has max Payne in it is sooo awesome. This could be one of the first horror games that delivers a 10/10 story, gameplay and scares. I play every major horror game and this is on par with re4 remake so far. Hope it continues to deliver.

I mean what the hell?!! Anyway I did not like the game that much cause it was quirky asf cause it is old but I might jump back into it cause of this second part it looks insane I like that they are mimicking the RE remake style .

Some long forgotten small youtuber playing Sly cooper and I clicked on his Alan playthrough for curiosity. After years later, I got my own pc in 2020 and saw it in the steam store.

Only thing I can possibly remember VEHEMENTLY disagreeing with Falcon on is Alan Wake. I am being sincere when I say it is the worst “game let down from expectations” I have ever experienced. I found the mechanics SUPER repetitive. I thought the aesthetic was a cheap trick to keep everything bland. The story did nothing for me. Born and raised in the Pacific Northwest so was disappointed by constant “gray” environments. See Infamous for how to make that area look beautiful. Sure there are plenty of other examples. I felt Remedy must have paid IGN/Gamespot/Gamestop massive amounts of money in review fluff because everyone loved it. I was young when I bought it too. Felt like I got scammed out of a bunch of money. Really set me back on ever getting an Alan Wake game again.,2023-10-27T14:28:33Z,0,0

My monitors are only 1080p so didn't really see the need to go all out of GPU when I saved up for a new computer and let all the money go for the CPU, Mobo, Ram & PSU. I wish developers would aim for min recommended specs having things run 1080p 60 native that way when tech like DLSS and the like are applied it only gets better.

How is it like those games?  Is it just inventory management and the feel?  And you said you had to be very careful and 'pick your shots' but on screen Saga unloaded 6 rounds into an enemy and it wasn't dead.  I have also heard the detective system is very boring, meaning its impossible to be wrong about a case or clue, its all very linear.   Whenever I don't hear ANY criticism that's a sure sign that maybe, you're very biased on this one,  like you said in the beginning. Where were the cons?  The no Physical Copy was a con of the game?

Performance was really good playing quality mode (which I never use), so that was cool. As a fan of the remedy universe I am pleased with this sequel so far. I really like all the nods, and easter eggs from their other games. To be transparent, there isnt alot of combat in the first chapter, so we will see if performance stays at this level. Graphically, all I can say is WOW, so good, almost looks like live action. Happy with my purchase.",2023-10-27T13:56:11Z,0,3

As I’m transitioning from games that only care about money and don’t leave you with good memories like nba 2k and madden! 🙄 but this looks really good ! I don’t usually buy single player games because after you’re done beating It there’s nothing to do with it but maybe play the story again on different difficulty. I’m playing dead space remake at this moment and this is my first time ever hearing or playing that game even from previous and I can say that game is pretty exciting I’ve played about 7-8 hours already and I’m enjoying it so I’m looking forward to jumping into more of these type of games now that I won’t be playing sports games anymore!

Then play American Nightmare. 
Pretty cheap on Steam and you could, honestly, beat both in a good sitting or two.

Furthermore, it should be noted that it is a ""showcase game"": it will be focused on new generation consoles, while on PC, it will be aimed at selling graphics cards, as if we didn't know how today's game industry works. 

Still on the Epic Games page, the game's specs remain in TBD if you go there, so as not to shock the public, but that's wrong, as they should inform the public so they don't have any disappointments.

It has been on my to play list for a long time actually. I have to say I found the story pretty amazing and that is what kept me going. The gameplay? Ugh hated it pretty bad. Eventually I got tired of enemies spawning behind me and killing me in a minute even on easy so I started running past all the enemies I could. The biggest nail in the coffin was that first dlc's boss which was horrible; literally brought me to tears how much I struggled. Finally managed it by hiding behind a pillar while I cleared the way since I only had one flare. I am really curious where the story will go though so I will pick this up eventually especially since it seems a bit more like the REmakes which I did enjoy immensely (namely 2 and 4).,2023-10-27T01:09:23Z,0,0

I REALLY want this game, and I think I want to dive in, I mean it looks amazing, but stressful survival horror, limited inventory... really not my genre... Are there accessibility modes that I can toggle on? I know Remedy, with the last couple updates to Control, put in some special boosts... Maybe there's something like that here?

Eh even if not, it's not a total deal-breaker. Will probably get it because this looks LAVISH.

Edit: 3 weeks later... Turns out it was.. a deal-breaker. Shame, too, because I liked what I played... I think just before the um... well, the thing that has been in Remedy games since the first Alan Wake and then again with Control, and I'm not spoiling what it is so...yeah. If I had seen it in 'person' I might have hung on a bit more but... the gameplay! Oh... this just proves to me I don't like survival horror... 

The game is VERY well made - make no mistake. I love how innovative it is! It's just... I'm sorry. I hope I haven't ruined my gamer cred :) I might pick it up again on Steam when it's there and if I've been able to shift my mind a bit - it'll be a double dip but REMEDY DESERVES IT!

Some were included in the soundtrack that was packaged with the Collectors edition of the game and some of the song were not included.

I wish (like you said) more people spoke on this. I get it, physical media, get on with it boomer, look at the music industry look at movies bla bla bla...

... I own all Remedy games (and Max Payne 3) physically (except Control), and they look cool on my shelf. I would like to get this there too. I am not strictly physical, but for games that I care about (such as Alan Wake), I'd like to have them on my shelf and actually own them. For people saying most games aren't even on disc, and require downloads. Yes, for day one patches and such, but tons of games still hold the entire game (in a playable state) on discs.

This is what happens when you partner up with Epic though, and was expected. Physical could come later on after digital sales are made (some games have been doing this I have noticed), but at that point I already bought the game digitally...

Regardless, great video as always Jake. :)",2023-10-26T22:17:31Z,0,0

This would be intense on the psvr2.

And just finished AW last week to get back in the story, so bring it on.

Edit: played it tonight and just stopped walking through the witches ladle.

What a game, haven't even seen the slightest glitch (got a patch today before i started.) 

Pace is just right, aw1 was a bit tedious at times but they nailed it here so far. Looks brilliant, controls are good. 

10/10 so far.

Playing ps5 btw, running it on quality mode an it feels like a steady 60fps here, it's the first game ever I didn't switch to performance after 5 minutes to be honest.",2023-10-26T21:18:01Z,0,0
