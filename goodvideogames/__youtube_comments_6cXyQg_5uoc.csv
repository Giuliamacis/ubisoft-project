However Uncharted 4 is beyond all of it. It does get a bit long at the end but the story is so strong I kept going. The mere fact I actually finished this game should tell you something. I don't finish most games. I could not help myself but had to see the finish. Without a doubt this is Tomb Raider on steroids and absolutely worth your time. O.G. Gamer,2021-02-06T18:16:06Z,0,0

I've been a Playstation fanboy for more than 20 years but I agree with everything she said in this review. The game had one memorable moment but the fact that they showed it in the first reveal trailer kind of ruined the experience for me. The story and the level design are great but when it comes to gameplay and set pieces the game really felt like it was lacking imagination.

1. 9 out of 10 is still an outstanding score


2. While IGN gave Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare a 9.1 out of 10, that review was by Brian Albert. Lucy O'Brien never personally reviewed a Call of Duty game for IGN. 

3. Lucy O'Brien also said Uncharted 4: A Thief's End  was a remarkable achievement in blockbuster storytelling and graphical beauty, only let down by an overly long third act. 


4. 9 out of 10 is still an outstanding score. Would you verbal attack your teacher or professor if she gave you a 90% on a school test? If you get offended this easily over someone's opinion, I'd hate to imagine how you'd react if your someone stole your wallet. Chill the heck down.",2019-09-15T00:29:29Z,0,1

There are some sections that feel drawn out and boring, and the stealth was not a great addition. It could have been if they gave you some silenced weapons. But no. So it ends up being a choir. Rafe and Nadine are both totally weak villains (both voice actors are great though) Also the whole thing with him having a brother doesn't really add up when you think of the three previous games but whatever. Still a terrific game of course. Also I would have preferred less great graphics for 60 fps but maybe thats just me. After replaying the first three on PS4 its hard to go back to playing 30fps.

This game is a great piece of art, but it's not all that fun to actually play.  Pacing issues, lots of padding throughout, Lots of open, empty areas, and too much brain-dead, boring, repetitive climbing sessions.  Just when the story seems to pick up, it's back to brain-dead climbing on the side of a mountain for 30 minutes, which ruins any sense of story momentum.  They try to add variety to the boring climb by adding stuff like boosting up Sam to drop a crate, or making cinematic jumps that look like Nate may fall, but it's all predictable after the first time you see it.

Previous Drake games, were shorter, yet had much more shootouts, action and balanced it with occasional climbing sessions.   This game is much longer, much less shootouts, much more climbing and walking.  This game should remove 50% of the pointless climbing, padding  and it would've been a much better game, and the story would flow perfectly.",2018-01-19T06:41:36Z,0,1

Call of Duty Black Ops 1 : 9.0
Call of Duty Modern Warfare : 8.5
Call of Duty Black Ops 2 : 8.7
Call of Duty Ghosts : 6.5
Call of Duty Advanced Warfare : 6.2
Call of Duty Black Ops 3 : 8.5
Call of Duty Infinite Warfare : 6.2

Now to Uncharted 4 
Uncharted 4 : 9.2

Other games , like GTA V
GTA V : 9.7
Star Wars Battlefront I 2015 : 9.1
Forza Motorsport 5 : 8.7
Forza Horizon 2 : 9.3
Forza Motorsport 6 : 9.3
Forza Horion 3 : 9.5
Batman Arkham Knight : 9.1
Fifa 17 : 9.1
Lego Star Wars The Force Awakens : 9.3 ( yes it is better than Uncharted , because it is very good as a Lego Game . Uncharted 4 is a very good game too but probably with Overwatch one of the most Overrated games that I've ever seen. And I actually like the Uncharted series and I own Uncharted 4. )
Mafia 3 : 7.6
Watch Dogs 2 : 8.6


This is just an example.

And let's be honest , Uncharted 4's graphics weren't as good as the people said.
And yes graphics are important to have a better looking game.
Or do you want the devolpers to go back to the Uncharted 1 graphics?

The bad parts of this game so far is how repetitive it is and how linear it is. Also where is the wildlife in that Madagascar area when driving the car?",2017-06-17T19:32:03Z,0,0

My feelings on this game tho is that it is a crown jewel inside a chest filled with stones. You don't get many games like this anymore. Everything lacks imagination these days, and Naughty Dog has always been in the front of the race with their storytelling and creativity. This game was a true masterpiece to me. I played the original UC 1-3 on PS3 and the Nathan Drake collection on PS4, so I would definitely say that I love the games. I absolutely love the characters. Nathan, Elena, and Sully are some of the best and most realistic feeling characters ever made and I compare them to another game (TLOU) which Naughty Dog has also made, in which the characters there are some of the best as well. The witty and funny banter between all the characters always makes me smile. I love hearing their voices, which are excellently acted, they feel like friends, uncles, aunts, whatever you want to call them, but they are very familiar voices and make me smile. The story in UC4 blew me away, and the ending fight had me at the edge of my seat. After the fight and everything was done, the epilogue was so sweet and made me actually feel good and happy. Not many games these days have that effect on people. I just don't personally understand how this game is just a 9. This game is the embodiment of 10/10. It has excellent writing, excellent combat, excellent voice acting, excellent music, and a fantastic cast of characters that grow on you from the first game to the last game, and it was an incredible journey to play all 4 of these works of art.",2017-06-17T18:11:05Z,0,3

a thing that i personally would have liked to see in Uncharted 4 was a chapter/level taking place in a city; like play as Nathan roaming through a street in New York city for example.
Uncharted 1 featured jungle landscapes, 2 snow, 3 sand, and 4 had a mix of everything.
i loved how Uncharted 3 had a chapter set in London; would've liked to see something like this in 4.
also, i personally would have liked to see Nathan in a chapter with a different 'look', for example with a beard or long hair, just to spice things up.
anyway, that's just a personal thing. absolutely loved the game as it is; all of them.",2017-02-26T18:34:31Z,0,0

There are many moments in the game that are just predictable and cliche that it is just unnecessary. There are quite a few occurrences that aren't needed which doesn't provide any substance or tension in the story. Those moments where Nate slips off rocks isn't putting you on edge. Elena pretending to be dead bit was just stupid which fluctuates the pacing. Those long winded levels were just really repetitive as stated in the review. Cut half of those levels and it wouldn't even make a difference. I wish they spend the time in making those levels with something more different than the norm but I guess they were just trying to hit the 15 hours gameplay mark or something. This means that there isn't much to tell in the story,  so in order to meet the hours they add long winded levels and unnecessary events. I consider The Last Of Us as a much better game because everything you do in the game has meaning to it and the things happening in the game has a reason for it. These are the reasons why, to me, that Uncharted 4 isn't a 10/10 game. This game is the best I've seen in terms of visual quality, with great combat as usual and good acting, but those set backs I mentioned just brings down the whole package a little for me.",2016-11-11T11:46:15Z,0,0

Overly long third act? you can see she was rushing to finish the review. The eye candy alone was worth it, the few times I got stuck the hints pushed me along fine. If anything the firefights were tedious for me, the AI buddy following me everywhere and not covering my back got annoying, played on hard and once I ignored the AI it was alright. I honestly didn't want to third act to end, the whole time you felt like you were actually exploring a real place, it was bittersweet when I got to New Devon.",2016-10-27T08:53:49Z,3,14

Repetitive platforming and box pushing, story was not appealing since its just one location after another, obsessive use of cliffhangers where character ""almost"" made it, ""almost"" dropped ""almost"" died, ""almost"" slipped, you get the point. No reward system, from beginning to end the same gameplay. 
The only pros about this game was graphics, character interaction of the world, physics and dynamics, voice acting, cutscenes and characters are almost real, dynamic AI.
Cons, bland story, excessive platforming, dry gameplay, lacking of creativity as the author puts it since you will be jumping from ledge to ledge and ""almost"" fell of the cliff 90% of the time. They should have just made another 'Last of Us' with this kind of graphics, at least you will be inclined to play from beginning to end. I feel like the gameplay and story did not do a good justice compared to the amount of graphical design that was put into.",2016-10-23T05:01:31Z,0,0

You should stop comparing ratings of every game with each other, it's an OPINION, by the particular reviewer. What does it matter to you, it's not like they're forcing their opinion on you.. And what's to complaint about a 9 anyway? If I ever had a 9 in class I'd be more than happy, it's a great score for a solid game.

GTA IV got a perfect 10, just like GTA 5, but with your way of thinking, if you didn't like those games, that would mean you will never enjoy a game because no game has ever had a higher rating. 

How can you be so butthurt and triggered, I don't understand. I see this on almost every IGN video, these kids don't understand what an opinion is and how they can be different from their own, so they just freak out and go and insult people. It's interesting to see the stupidity in these comments, and I wonder how these people will ever deal with actual disappointments in the real world.

People are dying in meaningless wars, children are starving of hunger, yet here you are crying out loud because this ""stupid and mean reviewer didn't give your favorite fanboy game a 10.

Graphics are amazing looks so real. The jumping/climbing is better than last 3 games  cause you have a grapple hook which makes it more fun now, puzzles are better and more interesting.

It is amazing in a lot of aspects but agree with the review, third act is way dragged out. I come from playing a lot of tomb raider game and I must say, tomb raider is a bit better than uncharted, the gameplay is just not as smooth. I never feelt the same smooth transition when climbing and shooting stuff as in tomb raider, its hard to explain just have to try both and see for yourself. It is also extremly linear, and non-open world. There is always just one way forward that is it. Which makes it a bit stale. Tomb raider suffers from the same problem, but i still feel more in uncharted like Im basically just travelling along a narrow corridor forwards to something. Would be interesting to see an uncharted, or tomb raider, that takes on a bit of a more open world approach. Like in metal gear solid phantom pain, but with climbing options. Still a fantastic game in many many aspects, i really enjoyed this game (well, except the third act).",2016-08-06T14:34:06Z,0,0

There wasn't really any major changes to the overall gameplay. And that's both bad and good. Bad because I was never particularly crazy about the gameplay. Good because, at least I knew how to play already with each installment. I hated the fixed camera areas where you can't change the view, or you're forced to run towards the screen. It also annoyed me throughout the series how you can't just freely climb anywhere (like in Assassin's Creed). You have to go through crap just to find a box to stand on in order to reach a ledge. Frustrating!¬† I started playing this series directly after Assassin's Creed Unity and Syndicate. I think the Uncharted games would have been MUCH more fun with the Assassin's Creed gameplay. It was still a great action series. But it definitely had it's flaws. Sadly, it's not the type of games I can picture ever playing again.",2016-07-22T12:17:13Z,0,0

Well for one thing, the chase sequence is probably the most dynamic and technically impressive action sequence ever in a video game, and the level design is the best in the series. She gave Evil Within a glowing review but that game was janky and uneven as hell. A 9 is still a great score, but some of her complaints are messed up.


I thought the sequence on the island was a bit drawn out too, but they spent the ENTIRE game trying to get to this point, so it makes sense to stay there for a major length of time. It's pacing is also fine, my only complaint being that sense you're on the island, it can all start to look a bit same-y, but thats just because the game was perfect about switching up environments leading up to that point.",2016-07-05T03:53:23Z,0,0

This realy isnt a good review not interms of the score but intermes of its content.,2016-05-31T18:18:35Z,3,0

An average game on IGN's score is 8 where it should be 5. For example the last 3 COD games got a higher score than this. But this game some how got a 9 when it is probably the best game on the PS4 so far. For Example Angry Joe gave this game a 9 out of 10 and no one was mad there because he almost never gives a 9 out of 10.,2016-05-31T14:44:09Z,3,6

Its not better than Uncharted 2 overall, Uncharted 2 use brought so many things into the series, it was perfect in every aspect.
But Uncharted 4 does improve in various aspects, maybe the story is not as good and some puzzle were pretty easy, but the shooting, climbing, fighting and graphics have been heavily improved.

Instead of just having 1 person do the official review with their 1 score and point of view, why not have 3 people give each their own reviews and scores and just give the average of the 3.

That sounds the most fair to me. Simply because of some of the previous reviews for 
games where their scores were kinda too high or low based on a ton of negative feedback from your viewers.

Lets kill a f**king country worth of enemies, only to send everything to hell."" And even if this game fixed some erros by adding features from other games, (Grappling Hook- Tomb Raider; Stealth that's very similair to MGS) playing trough three games that are basicly the same, only to end with a shinier, slightly better re-skin, this game is nothing special.

I love the encouragement for stealth gameplay (like The Last of Us) but the aiming/shooting mechanics aren't much better than Uncharted 3. Is it so hard to have it smooth like the first two? Platforming controls can be cumbersome as well. They seem to have gotten worse with the third & fourth game. Uncharted 2 will always be best. Best story, controls, villain, characters, set pieces, locations, music, etc. I'd really like to know what the original story for Uncharted 4 was to be, before creator Amy Henning left Naughty Dog. I wonder if it'd been better or worse? Overall, great game & good ending for the characters. Four is a lot like three for me; spectacular moments in a good game that is held back from complete greatness by a few issues, & development choices. Can't help but feel a little disappointed in Uncharted 4. Maybe I was expecting to much, & had my hopes to high.......",2016-05-17T18:07:31Z,4,1

All uncharted games were very mediocore for me BUT The graphics are very beautiful there were times where I would just stare at the screen. The voice acting and the cutscenes are very well done.

Elena's introduction didn't really make much sense and she became more of a main character than the player making it feel a bit dull. The rest was absolutely amazing, incredible. Definitely game of the year for me. I would give it a 9.5 as sometimes I had no idea where to go in the campaign and hints took 10 minutes of frustrating searching to appear an third act was a bit boring and dull.

Plus the boss fight at the end was fun. Some cons some levels seem to drag a little too long were other felt right some went too long. Some levels can feel really repetitive especially if you play on a higher difficulty but other then that the games pretty good crest acting with a good story and great graphics s must pickup if your into uncharted.

Each chapter was spent developing/rebuilding relationships and showing the scope of said locale. Without the length of the third act, there would have been relationship elements left unresolved. 

Just my 2 cents!!

This game (along with The Last of Us), tells story like no other game I've experienced, good job Naughty Dog!!

I feel Uncharted hasn't been a series that has come up with quite original ideas anyway. And this game does have new things. You're able to play as Sam at one time and you can drive both a car and a boat. It's a lot more open world than the other games in the series. The grappling hook is a new device and is a huge part of the gameplay. It's the best grappling hook in gaming, in my opinion, beating the Swingshot from Ratchet & Clank, the Hookshot from Zelda and the Lockjaw from Rayman. There's also the ice pick, which isn't utilised very much, but it's still fun to use and a new way to climb.",2016-05-14T13:04:37Z,0,0

I know people like to point out how the score they gave for this game doesn't seem to make much sense in comparison to higher scores they give to games that most would consider either inferior, or just as good. But one thing people have to remember, is that IGN isn't just a singular entity. It's comprised of a variety of crew members, who will all have vastly different opinions, perspectives, and biases towards the games are given to review.

Whether certain members are reliable or consistent with their critiques is definitely something that can be argued. But my point is that you can't just simply cherry-pick certain games that IGN as a whole have rated and compare their scores, because they've more than likely been reviewed by completely different people. It's only when the game is reviewed by the same person, that you can properly start to compare and contrast, and judge whether certain critiques consistently line up with one another. There can be exceptions to the rule, but for the most part, it isn't as simple as just comparing random scores.

The main reason why I think this review is flawed, isn't because they didn't give the game a perfect 10. My biggest issue was that a huge chunk of the review was dedicated towards pointing out how drawn out the game's 3rd act was, when it didn't end up having a huge impact on the overall score. Pointing out the issue isn't a problem in it of itself, but when it's given such a huge focus, there has to be a reason for it. The reviewer made it out to be a huge detriment, that took away from the experience in a significant way. But that ended up not being the case, so having it structured in a way that gave the criticism so much attention was pretty much pointless. In the end, it made the overall verdict appear rather confusing, as a lot of what the game did well seemed to be overshadowed by that complaint, but the score didn't reflect that at all. The overall structure of the review was messy and unbalanced, and it lacked consistency and clarity with the points it was trying to make.

That I think was ultimately this review's biggest downfall. Not because they didn't rate the game higher. And I think the people who are just criticizing the review for not giving the game a perfect 10 are being ridiculous. Nothing is immune to criticism, and insinuating that something is ultimately does more harm than good. There are flaws in every piece of media, and acknowledging their flaws, even if it's something you like, isn't a bad thing. Though the weight and/or credibility of certain criticisms can vary from person to person, it's always healthy to keep an open mind about it.",2016-05-14T04:11:14Z,0,0

Also the ending was upsetting for the 4th time he didnt get a treasure, i'm a huge fan of the uncharted series but naughty dog couldve done better, did it deserve a 9/10? no...but it also doesnt deserve a 10/10 because everything was too repetitive and convenient, uncharted 4 had its way of reminding you that this is just a game.",2016-05-13T23:53:35Z,1,0

I disagree on how you review this wonderful game. 9/10. Really? Try 10/10. This game is the best looking game period. But talking about how in the beginning of your video about it being slow in the game is false. 

This was in there because you sometime have to start slow and as the story moves forward then it pick up. That was the good part of this game, starting slow and then go fast, which i like in this game. Also there conversations was entertaining and part of what's going on in different area of each chapter. You did mention that the mult player is good and the shooting is better than the story mode. I can't comment on that because i haven't played this mode so judging by the video it looks the same to me until i play this mode

But Lucy for IGN, Clearly you don't know anything about reviewing this game and to see this video has over 5,000 dislikes, it shows. Game Spot had a better review than this. I can review the game better than you and I'm sorry. Bad thing is you said that its the prettiest game i ever played and still gave us this C- quality lazy review.

- Too repetitive
- The long cut scenes 
- You can¬¥t sprint 
- The driving segments are boring
- The story felt too long
- When you want to roll you sometimes get into cover and the opposite.
- There are invisible walls you can run into when you try to run around certain corners or around other characters

(Maybe same bish reviews it). Obviously people will compare the best of the best and Uncharted 4 is the one at the top. Many will compare imaginary said game with U4. And it if it fails in comparison to U4 on some level? What then? That's why a rating in reviews are flawed! Many will see U4 with a 9 and stupid imaginary game with a 10... (Quote me bish reviewer it will happen) and This whole fiasco will open up again, and bish reviewer legitimacy will be in question much more than it is now...

Criticism of a professional opinion is undoubtedly harsh. I do prefer some of the other reviewers, but that's because I'm more familiar with them through the podcasts, shows and so on. Due to that I know more clearly how their opinions relate to mine. That's personal preference rather than a critique of this woman.

She seems knowledgeable and has made a good review. Two people can formulate differing opinions on the same subject and neither are necessarily right or wrong.

And why do people get mad when ever someone has a different opinion then the majority so she didn't give the game a 10 so what is her score gonna stop you from playing the game and enjoying it ?? NO it isn't because I love the game so far they could've gave it a 2 and I wouldn't care IGN doesn't control if i like a game or not  let people be true to them and have their OWN OPINIONS,2016-05-11T15:41:15Z,2,2

And yeah, it comes down to the call of duty argument. People see that series, a series that hasn't innovated a damn thing in 10 years, get 9.3s and 9.5s every year.  Your review process is flawed and bias.  It stings people to see that, especially when that franchise out scores more respected franchises like uncharted. Games like alien isolation, a game that nailed aesthetic and frightening gameplay, gets blasted a five for repetitiveness but call of duty still gets 9s every year? Do you see yet where that doesn't make sense? You're review process is not done fairly for all games. This is why people don't find you credible anymore.

1. Uncharted is a Godsend. It is a perfect game and if you dare criticize it you should be murdured.
2. COD is the worst thing that ever happened to the human race and as such anyone who says anything positive about it should be murdured.
3. Battlefield 1 is going to KILL Call of Duty. It is the end of COD, it can R.I.P. Anyone who thinks otherwise should be murdured.
4. Overatch is better then Battleborn. Period. It doesn't matter they are 2 comletely different games. Overwatch is the winner. Anyone who thinks otherwise should be murdured.
5. If you don't follow these rules you should be murdured...

Why? Character development. In the previous games, the treasure was the focus of the plot. Civil War was a story focusing on the two main character's flaws than beating up a powerful enemy. 

Both have pacing issues, because it's trying to serve itself two different ways: one side praising the ridiculous fun captured by its predecessors, the other side is trying to explore the characters to make the story more understandable. So there are inevitably places where the product feels sluggish, because it leans on one side a bit too much. You can't really have this cake and eat it, too. 

That being said, it's fair that this reviewer dropped a point on Uncharted 4 for this. However, it was the pre-review thing that wasn't too bright. If you're going to publish a review, publish it once, and make sure it's complete. It doesn't matter if you miss the release date.",2016-05-11T14:18:32Z,0,0

If your gonna call something amazing then i suggest you lightly touch on its short comings and misses rather then sound so constantly up and down during your review. 
I will say this though, just because a certain formula has been working for the developer for so long should not be seen as a negative just because these amazing things that we've all seen Naughty Dog do before are just as we expected. If it ain't broke don't fix it!",2016-05-11T13:34:46Z,0,0

You don't review a game against another game let alone one in a completely different genre. You review a game against itself. You ask 'is this game as good as it can be - does it fulfil its potential - does it achieve what it set out to do?' The lady reviewing the game clearly had issues with the 3rd part of the game. I'm surprised she rated the game as high as she did really. It was sounding more like an 8.6 or something.,2016-05-11T13:23:32Z,0,1

Yet it gets almost the same as COD Ghosts and less than COD Advanced Warfare? Both of which were pretty shitty. I love MGS5 and you gave that higher than this when that game had a poor ending which is usually the best part of a game but gave this a 9 because just the third act got tedious ? Shambles.

For that reason each game that came out by naughty dog I would have higher standards for this game probably fell victim to that haven't played it yet but out of the three uncharted's the third was the most underwhelming and that got a great score why because these games make up for it in one way or another u3 had great co-op and mp with a story that backed it up and so on,2016-05-11T11:22:22Z,0,0

What they should be pissed about is this ""review in progress"" CRAP they keep pulling.

They deliberately do that dishonest crap, so major reviews get more hits and they move more traffic to their site, because people repeat view and check in on the review.

Rarely, it's warranted, sometimes the review er needs to check online features and functionality, sometimes the embargo isn't lifted in time or the publishers send out late review copies.

You spend two thirds of the game frantically racing from one point to another to another, there needed to be a solid breather; considering just how significant the conclusion of the second was, it was actually fitting.

You're labeling a significant portion of the game as repetitive but I guess I'm the only one that felt Rise of the Tomb Raider was just flat out boring; wonder what it was that gave it a better score? Surely nobody is pathetic enough to disregard everything one game does better than another because of the gender of the lead character. Right? Perhaps the somber moments that broke up the repetitiveness of the third act were lost on you; while it slowed, absolutely, it was exploring something almost their entire childhood in the making, or it was the somber moments on the elevators or driving up the rocky path with the rather depressing music drowning out the car noise and the environment. Sure, it wasn't perfect, but it was fine. 

Game deserves better than a 9, better than Rise of the Tomb Raider, better than any Call of Duty released in recent years and absolutely whatever score this next one will get. Truthfully I couldn't give a rat's arse about the score, to me the game was easily the best game I've ever played; 10/10 doesn't cut it.

Well dont blame IGN for your insecuritys..
Uncharted 4 is a goood game, but its not that great, 9/10 is totally fair if not even to High.
The Campaign gets boring after one play though, the Multiplayer is really average, and the Gameplay itself is nothing new and pretty 1st Grade Actually. The best thing about this game are the Graphics.

Only so much work can be done to make it enjoyable, immersive and all that other good stuff without taking so long. Kinks happen but that's just game development, it happens in films (editing mistakes, set workers have a sneaky accidental cameo) and novels (Jane Eyre is a 200+ year old literary masterpiece yet, with its 7th revised edition, there are still grammar and punctuation errors). Not to say that I'm a game developer, because I'm not, but if I were, this is a great score in the grand scheme of things. I want to know what you guys think, what don't you guys seriously like about this review (aside from it being pretty vague but it is also short so it's more concise if anything) or the score this game received?
