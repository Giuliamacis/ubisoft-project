Yeah i get it the game is buggy, physics are better in gta5, but they are 100% diferrent games. Gta is not an rpg. Gta5 was fun even though the story was a little bit dull, and the game does have little content outside the story compared to san andreas for example. Overall a fun game but you can easily see that rockstar used most of their forces to make it the best online game, and not the best in storymode. On the other hand, cyberpunk is all about story and it's rpg mechanics and choice making... Buggy... Yeah... Unfinished... Yeah.... Bad?.. Hell no. A much more comparable title would be the cult classic vampire the masquerade bloodlines. Unusually similar.. Very intriguing story and amazing choice making and character customization in an immersive world that feels real, but both are buggy as hell",2020-12-25T14:50:32Z,0,0

This game is a great game but is not better than gta 4 or sanandreas. To describe gta 5 in one word 'HEIST'. A lot of heists but it was a great experience to do the heist but the game must have taken the main point of the storyline (Betrayal of Michael) more serious rather than the heist. In conclusion this is a great game with many places to explore but has no strong characters. This is not better than it's predecessor. (8.8)",2018-07-31T20:36:38Z,0,1

Vice City in terms of music and cel shaded atmosphere and San Andreas as you already know is the main location where this game takes place.

Last GTA I actually played was SA lol so it's been awhile. Can't wait for 6 but I want to them to take their time. My FAVOURITE part about GTA is that unlike other games that are biased politically, GTA finds a way to be POLITICAL without cherry picking or choosing sides. It just displays everyone's insanity rather than try to make one side look better than the other and there being a ""right and wrong"" side. Hope they continue to do that.",2017-08-13T18:22:54Z,0,11

Instead of working for crime mobs and making a name in the criminal underworld, the main story revolves around your 3 characters most of the time working as servants of the feds and corrupt govt entities - government dogs. The supposed ""happy ending"" in the final mission is disappointing and unfulfilling.  Its a big foul in the GTA theme.

But I have to say, GTA V was bit of a letdown. The graphics was nice, the open-world was amazing. But the story line was pretty lame to me. Making a GTA game and basing it off of heist was an bad idea to me. It made the game too one dimensional if you will. And pointless missions, such Trevor stealing that war head, making the gamer go through all that effort for nothing, is just plain f*cking stupid. Vice City is still the most popular GTA because of all¬†the sh*t you can do, and the story line. The same can be said about San Andreas. GTA V didn't even utilize any of the many gangs on the game.

The story isn't all that different. Aside from different characters, visuals, and gameplay. It's like COD. Except less 12 years old yelling at you and The game isn't shooting itself in the foot. The online experiance isn't anything fascinating either. Just same thing you did in San Andreas, but With real online players and No cheat codes. Game was atleast fun when you had the glitches. Like going under the streets and Killing other players. Without the glitches it just seems like your everyday casual shooter. Online play isn't a challenge if you understand the basic mechanics and Theres no play making either. So I could understand if the game was fun for casuals, but Playing the game and Taking it as a serious challenge? Kinda makes you a pleb. So overall casual average game.

1. The story could have better writing in some areas.. some big moments in the game are ruined by cliche writing.
2. The endings were all pretty weak imo and if you don't choose C loose ends aren't explained.
3. The cover system could take notes from games like the division
4. Mission diversity was much better than previous GTA games but could be better
5. Upgrading weapons could be better maybe take a level system from like an RPG game or something.. adding most attachments don't make a difference
6. Cool things like buying houses and stuff can't be done in story but can be done in online
7. Adding a female lead would be dope
8. Make pricing for things more realistic
9. Make the world interactive.. go in more buildings break walls
10. Some of the heist and other missions should have been longer and maybe more exciting some of them seemed to be a let down
11. Take away some of the dumb cliche stuff and stop trying to make it so funny.. some of the jokes they make or the news that comes on or things that are reality in this game are just foolish
12. Make the missions realistic so you're not just like god murdering everybody and unstoppable
13. Make the missions real so that you have to do things to keep from getting caught instead of just doing whatever and never having a chance of the cops catching you after flying a huge chopper through the sky with a train hanging from it",2016-12-31T06:43:37Z,0,0

I would actually like to be able to live a normal life meaning getting a job, going to a restaurant and ordering food and actually eating the food and stuff like that. I got this idea after I beat the game and I was walking around, it's really interesting, the city looks to be very alive but there's nothing to do afterwards. I would like those every day things to be in the game so you can feel that complete immersion. To feel that your character is actually alive would be an awesome thing. Maybe having the ability to make yourself a sandwich or actually cleaning your house, stuff like that.

Following one of rockstar's greatest games of all time in 2010 came Red Dead Redemption literally one of the greatest games of our time. Upon that in 2011 Rockstar gave us LA Noire. A game that was a revolution at the time and even further in 2012 Max Payne a game that proved time doesn't matter in a video game's durability. Monumentally in 2013 Rockstar managed to pull off what was considered and is considered the greatest game of our generation Grand Theft Auto V only five short years after GTA IV they managed to accomplish all those games. I applaud you rockstar. Amazing to think that in 2 years time a new GTA may be hitting shelves.,2016-08-12T11:47:41Z,22,250

For one - the style of the missions seems to finally be showing its age. Second, the fact that you can't go inside buildings is almost maddening. In a weird way because of that one feature - it felt like a huge step back. The three character thing is cool - but i'm not sure there was ever a compelling enough reason to want to switch other than regular narrative reasons. 

The reviewer is right - it's def. the most polished GTA game yet; but it's an aged style of game that just didn't grab me in any way, shape or form like III, VC, SA, or IV did. Fun game - heck - great game. But it wasn't something that was blow away to me.",2015-10-12T07:56:19Z,1,1

The frame rate issues are huge. The game lags to the point where I cant steer the car accurately or even move the camera. Its so weird because it really just gets worse the longer you play, but having to reset the game every seven minutes detracts from the experience. The game barely runs after I set the graphics to the minimal setting, even though i've never had to do that with my other games. ""10/10"" ""remarkably bug-free""",2015-07-22T00:04:07Z,1,0

Firstly, the combat and shooting is very downgraded and not at all as good as Rockstars previous entries such as Max Payne 3, Red Dead Redemption and even Grand Theft Auto IV.

Secondly, the physics and car damage are a complete joke compared to previous Grand Theft Auto games or ¬†other Rockstar titles. The car damage is not as realistic as even Grand Theft Auto III, and that's saying something.

Thirdly, the story and the characters are rubbish.

I'm not saying that the game is bad or terrible. But it has way more issues and problems than previous Grand Theft Auto or Rockstar titles.",2015-06-30T03:33:02Z,9,29

I love sandbox games and definitely play a variety of genres of games but this games story is just....boring. Like I don't understand what it is that I'm missing. I enjoy Michael and Franklin's segments, (Trevor does make me laugh my ass off but can be pretty annoying and tiresome as well) and I do like the satiric take on today's modern culture but the missions all feel disjointed and like there is no over arching plot to the whole thing. I'd say I'm maybe like 35 to 40 percent through it and that's only because it feels like such a chore to try and get through. I can only play one mission before I get bored and have to put it down. I honestly only bought the game to have another game to play with my friend online but I'm that kind of person that must play the story before going online since sometimes there's control mechanics that you need to learn in the story first. I don't know, this is my first GTA game and I did get to play a little bit of GTA4 and Mafia 2 at another friends house and I honestly liked Mafia better but I just don't know how I feel about this game. I played through Watch Dogs and enjoyed that. I didn't love it but I also didn't go in super hyped up like everyone else did. I just thought it looked cool and it was cool. But it at least had a good flow to the story. You always knew what you were doing. Sleeping Dogs is kind of mix between Watch Dogs and GTA5 for me. I really didn't like Wei that much because the game didn't show him as a cop enough to make his sense of morality matter at all so he came off as kind of an ass but the gameplay was pretty good and again I usually always felt like the story had some direction that it was going in.

Yeah these guys were good, funny, badass, and all of that. But the story and the overall tone of the story made me feel like I was watching a comedy movie, as opposed to a serious Story. This is like the Saints Row 1-2 to the Saints Row 3-4. They were serious and you cared abit more.

The cars handle so much better but its not fun slamming them into a wall and only getting a little kink in the car. GTA IV was so much better at this which is why I loved playing just to demolish cars until I couldnt drive them anymore. GTA V is more arcade like this time but not for everyone. I loved GTA SA because of the countryside where you can drive like crazy through trails and fields. In GTA V Rockstar's sense of detail felt like they HAD to put a rock and hills in every square foot of the map so that was what killed it for me.,2015-01-13T18:50:42Z,0,3

The story is terrible, it's pretty much 3 guys screwing people over money, killing innocent bystanders for no reason.
The characters are bullshit, I hate pretty much all of them and wish they would just die, and I don't mean just the main characters or even major or minor characters. I hate pretty much every character in the game.
The gameplay is fun but nothing new and I didn't have that much fun with it either.
But I will admit the graphics are nice and the online if fun, but overall GTA 5 doesn't offer anything new or interesting

1. more of an open world
2. good graphics
3 three main characters
4 better cars and weapons
my only issues with the game is it seemed to lack in the story , the plot wasnt really as good as gta iv's , it seemed too short and franklin's story was kind of lacking too he seemed more like a third wheel i would have liked to see more hood missons with franklin and lamar and more story on the families and ballas

I'm going to get called a noob and as casual and told i didnt get the game but srsly:
-Characters were boring, annoying and rarely were they ever fun to play as
-Main plot was seriously uninteresting
-Got boring pretty quick due to how repetitive it felt
There were so many more problems that I had, but I will give it credit where it's due:
-The City is amazing, big open world just like how it should be
-gameplay was smooth and the cars were great
-Amazing graphics and character models
Basically, GTA V was like a supermodel:
Good looking, but nothing on the inside to keep you interested.
That was a pretty sexist thing to say but meh you get my point.

The map is absolutely stunning, but I felt the story had little substance. The first 10 hours were superb, it ran out of steam quickly; the novelty wore off and I didn't care for the story after a while. I thought the heists got worse as the game progressed. Critiquing the game, I found myself praising GTA IV much more (pre-GTA V I had a decent - good opinion of it) as a lot of the good stuff in GTA V is from GTA IV; GTA V merely ¬†developed it more, refining it, but nothing as ground-breaking as the initial inceptions in IV. Personally though, I think some of my opinion stems from the fact that The Last Of Us was brilliant in terms of story-telling (and less so on scope) and Breaking Bad was ending (another story-driven franchise), and both came out weeks before GTA V, hence my criticism of the story in GTA. It was going to be difficult to top either in that department. But to each their own.

Overall, a very good game, probably a masterpiece in ambition and scope, but fails in terms of story in my opinion. Perhaps a 8.5 - 9.0 would have been a more accurate score for me.¬†",2014-09-14T12:44:24Z,0,1

I work security for a private company and they did well showing how the private sector work. In GTA V if you commit a crime in the view of a security guard you will get 1 star immediately and the guard will attack you. On my job, when we witness a crime we call police immediately and detain the criminal until the police arrive. Also in GTA when you punch a security guard he won't shoot you but instead pull a baton out and defend himself, in my job if someone attacks us hand to hand,¬†we would use pepper spray or a baton to bring the suspect down then detain him. And in GTA if you shoot at the¬†security officer¬†he will return fire with his pistol. In security we do carry firearms for our defense and the defense of other people and will return fire when we realize that lives are at stake. The game designer of GTA V did a perfect depiction of security officers as well as the private military contractors. Fantastic graphics, great activities etc. I do think it would be nice if they added boxing classes, and better clothing choices. I love GTA way more than Saints Row but I¬†like the idea of how Saints Row had the store ""Make Pretend"". If GTA adds a store like¬†that and lets you customize your character to look like a police officer, SWAT officer, security officer, soldier, bouncer, hazmat suit, flight suit¬†etc. This will make the game absolutely outstanding. And more vigilante work! No one wants to be just a cab driver, I liked shooting the bad guys in a police car, and putting out fires too! It would be sick if they added a vigilante job for the Merry weather patrol car, where it shows a property on the GPS, you drive to the property, patrol through it, and taser or fight the criminals committing crimes on the property.

I suppose COD is an allegory for some dreary Euro- dissertation on American imperialism and Assasins Creed is some harangue on the woes of religion.

Anyways, back to my vidya. Maybe I can find a game where I command the British empire ruling the world. Because ancient friggin' history can be as fun as any fantasy.

The characters look like they are from a 3d pixar movie, with correct shading, dimensions, and colors. The attention to detail is mind blowing with the map appearing so realistic it's almost like watching google earth satellite photos. Games like this and Skyrim really push the limits of the PS3 hardware. They aren't afraid to show you the detail of an ugly, bald person too. Some games like Final Fantasy make all their characters look like supermodels and it's just too bubblegummy I think.

The missions are kind of walk here and shoot here with not very much room for player decisions, other than being able to choose who to shoot first and in what order- the kind of combat which game developers seem to think is significant. 
But these are all just petty issues over shadowed by the impressive photorealism and all that good stuff.

The story was great, but short and they didn't take full advantage of having 3 playable characters to have more individual missions (missions for each character). The ending seemed to be very rushed.  All of the arch enemies of the 3 main characters are killed in the same, boring way. GTA online is very fun, but filled with glitches. It seems Rockstar has fixed all of the glitches that are beneficial to the player and have forgotten about some other annoying glitches. The missions give almost no money and they are yet to add heist. This game had such high potential and it wasn't ultimately achieved. 8.6/10.",2014-07-02T01:37:46Z,0,0

I haven't played the game yet. But I've seen just about every mission walkthrough on YouTube, and I was disappointed. GTA V felt like a dark comedy hard pressed on trying to be a Michael Bay film with its conjuction of gangsterism & overused explosive action; too many plots on trying to steal military weapons and vehicles from the government all while being on the continuous pursuit of the almighty dollar. On this note, the game doesn't take itself seriously.
Grand Theft Auto IV on the other hand was like watching a rich and vivid Martin Scorsese film. I really loved GTA IV because of its relatable character and its dark & gritty take on crime and the pursuit of the American Dream. Not to mention the fact that the reimagining of Liberty City unifies every single feature of the game.

To say that Rockstar shouldn't be merited for GTA V is wrong beyond fucking recognition, because they should! GTA V is an impressive looking game. I just feel that IV takes the cake here for the reasons stated.Ôªø",2014-06-30T19:59:28Z,0,1

Not to mention how Rockstar added shitty features in the game like yoga and golfing. I think this game was just way overhyped and people are to blind to see that this game is a step backwards in terms of GTA i mean GTA 4 is better than this game.

So i decided to just give it back to my friend.

A 10 is for a once in a decade game that is a pure masterpiece, GTA V falls short of that mark. The ONLY enjoyable part of the story were the heist and the vast majority of the characters were forgettable. At times it is so cartoon-ish and crude to the point where I couldn't take it seriously. Los Santos is a generic city and the rest of the world isn't even worth visiting. There are pretty much no enjoyable side missions or random encounters and shootouts and police chases get boring very fast because the cops are terminators.¬†

I enjoyed the game, but it began to felt like a life simulator way to soon. If only they focused more, a lot more, on the story. It doesn't even come close to the God of all Rockstar Games: Red Dead Redemption. 7.8/10",2014-06-20T07:01:54Z,1,15

I have played both and personally like Watch Dogs concept more since its more realistic. You get punished for killing civilians since they instantly call the police which is very hard. GTA 5 in the other hand is more fun with our friends since its online modes are better and overall its a unrealistically fun!

All good open-world games tho I find SD to be the best overall experience. WD and GTA V are more polished but fluid combat, nice touches like hijacking cars while driving and Departed-like plot left much better impression.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UB5hpk0iqg,GTA 5 - Review,2013-09-16T14:26:01Z,@TheRealRobertBlarg,"I have a question about this game. I think it looks bloody amazing and the only reasons I haven't gotten it yet are 1. because I have a few other games still to finish and I just KNOW this game will eat up my time and 2. I'm hesitant to get it when a next gen version might be just around the corner and I have a rule that I want to stick to: if a game is coming out for both current and next gen systems, I want the next gen version even if it's only slightly better because hey, it's slightly better.

Anyway, I've never really played the GTA series before... I love open world games and Rockstar makes some of the best if not THE best. I just couldn't get into GTA IV. Not exactly sure why. But Red Dead Redemption is a masterpiece IMO. Now, obviously... GTA and RDR are wildly different but one of my favorite things in RDR were the dynamic random world events: saving a girl from being raped, chasing down a store robber or a horse thief, being ambushed on the side of the road by outlaws who used an ""innocent"" woman to lure me over, all of that stuff. I love that kind of element to open world games. Spiderman 2 is another brilliant example.

It can get repetitive sure, but it's always nice to be able to load up a game and always have something to do even if the story is over. So... does GTA V have that sort of stuff? I know it definitely has side missions but RDR ALSO had side missions in the form of Stranger missions. So is there anything that just happens when you're driving around Los Santos and a little blip on the map appears, you go and investigate and.... something happens or no?",2014-03-10T04:33:19Z,2,0

1- 85% of this game is just driving around the city , including some key story parts evolve just in a speech mode while you're driving from point A to point B
2- missions get repetitive and you have to go through the same cycle of "" preparing "" to a heist¬† which is simply go across the city get an item then go across the city get the other item and when the mission starts the main action part is shooting a ridiculous amount of enemies , so yea same shit repeating itself
3-not much variety for example when franklin [ spoiler ] moved to another house i got¬† bored of it within 4 minutes because it offers nothing new¬† other than the swimming pool which you can't do anything in anyway , even calling relatives / friends will not give you anything but a conversation most of the time .
its nice to be able to run / drive around but in the middle of the game i just got bored and started only following main quests to get over with it , there is emptiness in the game which reminded me why i didn't like the previous ones , you can hate on me but i don't give a shit , this game is¬† 7 out of 10",2014-02-12T14:49:01Z,8,1

If you have your favourite food everyday you will get bored of it, just like doing nothing but heists on gta V got boring. Gta SA's Caligula's heist was good because there was other missions. Gta IV had good missions but the gameplay wasn't as good as V.

Also we need more Islands. There was no reason for me to explore the map on V. Having boundaries makes it a lot more anticipating. The previous gta's where good because I couldn't get to the next island, this made me wonder what rockstar has in store for me when I progress in the game. I didn't have that same feeling, not even 1%.

GTA IV online was a lot more fun than GTA V online, I don't want to worry about if I have enough money to buy cars, car mods, houses, weapons and ammunition. I just wan't to have fun. Not think about if I destroyed a personal vehicle or not. GTA IV's free mode was the most fun I've had. If they included a IV styled free mode as an option then I would play it more. Who didn't love battling it out at the airport on IV?

While the story was a little short, the missions were very fun. I bought GTA V on launch day and to this day the game disc is still in my PS3. I haven't taken it out from the system since September. There is a HUGE pile of stuff to do after the story (not counting multiplayer). And although there were some bugs in GTA Online, I wasn't really affected by them. GTA Online is so fun. The satisfaction that I got after buying myself my first expensive apartment in the game with my hard-earned money is something that I cannot describe. There is one thing that I disliked about this game. The atmosphere. I was so obsessed with Red Dead Redemption... it really felt like you were in the game. Here... not so much. Maybe it's because the game is set in 2013??? Who knows. 9.9/10",2014-01-18T00:46:29Z,1,0

That doesnt mean you can do a lot of things RIGHT, or that all the things you can do are fun. I have play for 10 hours now, an I cant believe the following:
1) The controls suck
2) Driving ir KIND OFF FUNNY
3) A lot of missions, drive from point A to point B kill and come back.
4) Why the hell is aiming so EASY and when you turn off the aiming aid it becomes impossible to kill anyone.
5) Why isnt there a good fighting mechanic?

I was annoyed by EVERYONE spamming me with invites as well as the hate comments I got when I expressed my opinion to these people. I don't like how the game just is so plain dirty for the sake of being dirty. I'm not going to go over that as the reviewer covered it well. That's not to say I'm a prude, but take Borderlands 2 for example. I love that game as it has entertaining story, epic guns and loads of variety. It's just as crude, however I can't take it seriously due to the fact it's nothing like the real world. GTA V just seems like it's trying to hard to deviate and be controversial.

There is so much to do, fly planes, ride takes, steal takes and planes, ride bicycles, cars, drive 18 wheeler trucks, shoot mountain lions, shoot elk, shoot real estate signs, rip off famous movies stars memorabilia, you name it. The map is vast and so much to discover. You won't get bored at all. Just riding around in cars, trucks and planes makes this game worth it. You can fly 747 passenger planes. In one of the missions you fly a plane into the cargo hold of another, well thought out missions and super super fun.

I have seen some negative reviews and I can only explain them by the fact they have not played the game.

Only negative comment I can make, is there is too much swearing for my taste, but after all it is GTA.

Missions are great and enjoyable, having 3 characters is fun and doing missions as a trio is fun and well done.

I mean, I understand why people hate CoD, but I will never understand why hate a game that shows the look of America today! Rockstar said that GTA V is a living satire, that it criticizes the modern life of an average American. The people who dislike the game are actually living examples of the bad shown in here. GTA IV was hated because of it's choice of main character who was the first not to be American, in fact he was of a nationality that the Americans didn't really please and of course because of it's urban free roaming space. People, the size of the map was like that because it fitted the economy style of that day America, and Rockstar probably outdid themselves with their choice of playground. Why hate GTA V? Because it's boring? If it's so fucking boring, why not go and play some fucking CoD instead just posting ridiculous comments here in the first place.

It's incredibly detailed and Rockstar was very innovative in terms of creating a game that has three protagonists. The only issues that I have with GTA 5 is the soundtrack and the way the storyline was structured. In terms of music, there were a few good songs here and there, but Rockstar could've done so much better with the game's music overall. As for the story, it would've been nice if Rockstar established a balance between playing all three protagonists during a few missions and playing only one protagonist during a few other missions. Those are just my personal opinions, but other than that, GTA 5 is an awesome game.",2013-12-11T04:47:10Z,0,0

Ok so Rockstar games began on PC and was great but for some reason they moved to console. in my experience consoles have ruined many great games do to the hardware cap. if they continue on this route they will loose many customers mainly because consoles can't keep up with evolution of games and thier graphics. Consoles have limited games since they came out, I'm not trying to start a war between the 2 races I'm trying to prevent limitations on games caused by consoles. PC's can be upgraded consoles can't. many don't see or do but ignore it. thier is no better platform. games are created on PC they should stay on PC. to continue the evolution to graphics consoles must stop being produced",2013-12-01T00:35:09Z,0,0

The environment is ugly, there is no incentive to hunt (or steal cars anymore), the mini games are even more boring than in GTA IV, and characters are either developed too little (like Franklin) or just not enjoyable (like Trevor).

¬†yeah is free i get it but the money that i was making in racing was more awesome then fucking beach theme cars, clothes and tattos, so i say rockstar just take back your shitty update and let me make money online, no instead they fucked it up by lowering the money from racing, parachuting, deathmatches and any kind of fun/replayable mission

if you are looking for a good solid rockstar game i say play gta san andreas trust me you wont be dissapointed, more myths more missions, more fun, less graphics if you ask me rockstar has gone a HUGE step down, they had this beatifull map with 3 character, instead the story is easily forgetable and it just does not feel right",2013-11-20T02:50:11Z,0,0

There was only 69 missions and they were divided between 3 characters, where as in GTA SA and IV, there were over 90 missions. Because the story was so short, I could never really get connected to the characters or their stories. It felt too much like an action movie with unrealistic, over-the-top missions over and over again. I get that the GTA IV's most popular mission was the heist mission, but don't make your whole game on one mission. It was the most popular mission because there was only one of them, which made it special. They really improved the gameplay, customization, and added more of a variety of stuff to do and access, which was missing in GTA IV. But what they didn't improve on was the writing and the story itself. GTA IV had the best story in a GTA game to date in my opinion, but GTA V's story felt rushed and not very well written. If you're going to have a game with 3 characters, then have 3 times the missions as well. I never really learned anything about the characters like I did in GTA 4 or Red Dead, which made me not care about them. Also the map is not as big as I hoped it would be, with many things unused like the prison and military base. I think a GTA game with a story like GTA 4 and gameplay like GTA V would be a perfect 10 game, but sadly, this game is overrated. Rockstar focused on story in GTA IV and not on gameplay, and in this game they focused on gameplay, and not much on story. When compared to games like GTA IV, Red Dead, Max Payne, and LA Noire, this game's story just doesn't compare. The idea is good, and it could've been better if the story was longer. I know I'm going to get hate from this, but that's just how I feel.",2013-11-14T00:09:19Z,13,13

Arkham Origins isn't as good as it's previous games, AC4 looks stupid. It reminds me of a dead horse getting beaten.  God of War: Ascension was a real disappointment.

It seems like the best game this year, would be GTA 5. It's an almost perfect game and it's a huge step up from GTA 4. (GTA 4 is also awesome) Can't wait for GTA 6. ",2013-11-06T01:34:21Z,0,0

Calling something overhyped is pathetic though, it's basically like saying that your opinion on the game is somehow fact and the number of people buying and enjoying the game doesn't matter.

COD has a more dramatic and shocking campaign unlike any other game. Also, COD comes out with plenty of content each year and is always different from there past amazing games unlike gta where you kill people and thats all.

How can you possibly judge a nation whose area is the third largest in the world when you don't even live there.  There are way to many people who like to say nasty things about the US.  Believe it or not like any other country people in America vary greatly depending on where you are and lumping us all into a single group is racist.,2013-10-10T12:06:55Z,0,0

But I wouldn't agree with some of the opinions in this review.
mainly:
1) ""The social satire in GTA 5 is clever and witty"". It felt to me as if one of the ""south park"" episodes was written by couple of fans from high school. No jokes. Only mean comments towards different stereotypes and social phenomenons of past 3 years. 
2) ""Story is superb"". It's just not. It has it's moment, but it's mainly about reasons for player to cause chaos and mayhem.",2013-10-09T23:59:00Z,0,0

The only really impressive thing about the game is its size. But most of the world is pretty rural and unpopulated so... meh.
Also, the characters, while funny, feel artificial and lack any sort of emotional depth. They just curse and shout cheesy one-liners the whole game.
The game is fun, but still buggy and unfair at times. The graphics are good for an open-world game but bland, but the load times blow.

This game wasted a lot of potential heists. There's a Casino in the game that you can't even fucking enter. That would've been an epic heist. Also you can't rob banks unless its in a mission which only happens twice... only twice out of the 69 missions. Such wasted potential in sacrifice for GTA: Online.

Notice how infinitely small that proportion is. Saying that playing GTA makes you into a psychopathic mass murderer is like saying that reading a Batman comic is more likely to turn you into a masked vigilante.

You might as well blame ceral boxes with violent cartoons on them if you head down that road. i blame just about every evil person on parenting. The way i see it, if you are raised properly you understand good from bad, and no matter how shitty life can be at times, that threshold stands firm and you are able to withstrain yourself. If you are not taught what you should and should not do then the ability to make those decisions becomes frail the further you go in life.",2013-10-02T23:59:15Z,0,0

you didn't get emotionally attached to character like you did with CJ
No San Fierro and Las Venturas made the game less exiting
frankin should have been more involved in the gang
Trevor should have started his meth lab and business
the game was too focused on heists

only around 69 missions, take away the assassination missions and collecting vehicles for heists then it is around 58 main story missions.

There are a decent number of songs in the game that didn't exist before any previous games came out.
There is a right-wing and a left-wing parody news outlet in the game, both publishing the same number of articles.

1. San Andreas was bigger.
2. At NO POINT can you accomplish a mission another way than Rockstar intended.
3. The songs and stations (And TV Shows) are ALL recycled from previous games.
4. All jokes are the same and tired directed entirely at the right rarely the left.
5. Michael and Trevor have the SAME special ability. Hence not unique.

1. Uncontrolled Praising/Bashing of a game

3. People get nostalgic, and don't remember the negative aspects of the game.

1. You die too easily.
2. After I had completed all the missions I was pretty bored, especially with no online as of yet.
3. Pretty disappointing with only 2 heists which pay out pretty big.
4. Car spawns are pretty annoying, there are way too many of the same types at any one time, different variants of cars take so long to spawn. 
5. The driving for me is too sensitive, I much prefered GTA4.
6. No crouch.

only good things were the graphics, which arent very good for their time and the huge map but thats it...i give this game a 5 out of 10, most disapointing game of all time.",2013-09-24T19:10:48Z,0,0

Animals are completely pointless in the game and they are very limited. The game didn't take advantage of landmarks, a few examples is that they didn't take advantage of the prison, the military base or other places that you'd think a mission would take place in. The story mode had flaws too, not a great ending, most money is only given at the end of the game and Grove St and Ballas were just ignored!

In accomplishing one of the greatest feats in modern gaming, GTA V has exceeded the almost insurmountable hype that preceded it.
Within its diverse environments, silky smooth gameplay, and down-right brilliant satire of popular culture, GTA V stands out as one of the most wholly brilliant  pieces of technological art ever created.

Again, console owners, thank you for spending money, so we don't have to.

Also you need to be able to take more damage. Also running should only deplete stamina not your health after running too long. But armor shouldn't be depleted by physical blows. In GTA IV you lost health when you fell or got punched. In GTA V you lose armor also.,2013-09-22T20:22:27Z,0,0

The current consoles have something left to offer? That's kinda funny as seeing how there's constant signs of low framerate, and old hardware with every new game. Just like the problems GTA 5 is currently having. It doesn't have anything left to offer.
Sure they developed GTA 5 for current-gen consoles, but that's cause they didn't want to bet on a new console quite yet.

Still with it's in depth story, tons of activities to participate in, and sympathetic characters you probably shouldn't sympathize with but you do anyway... it really sets the bar.. Hell!

Also (grabbing a random series here) COD in my opinion isn't very good yet it sells millions each year. WOW has also been out a lot longer than TLOU, so it's obvious it would sell more. The amount TLOU made for being a PS exclusive in the first month was amazing and as GTA 5 is multiplatform it is expected to make millions.",2013-09-19T19:28:26Z,0,0

It was probably the most fun I had ever had playing a rockstar game. Now..... idk about you, but I buy games based off how fun I think they'll be, not off of how creative it was..... you sound like somebody who spent 500$ on abstract art, and wants to justify the buy by saying ""its creative"" when in reality its just a bunch of tai dye colors swirling around......",2013-09-19T02:34:46Z,0,0

I'm not worried about the score which they (and others) gave the game...as long as they support their opinions with evidence within the actual review. i.e. how well the reviewer explains delivers their perspective. In this case i just found that IGN did a better job of supporting their opinions in a way that didn't feel biased or overly subjective. ,2013-09-19T02:15:01Z,0,0

This game deserves nothing more than a 4 at best. It has a batshit insane plot that implodes on itself, its characters are cardboard cutouts, the graphics are some of the most god awful I've ever seen, and the gameplay is either boring or downright broken. To top it off, it's sexist, racist, and misogynist.

Plus IGN have down-marked games for clipping and pop-in textures before, to a degree GTAV suffers from this yet isn't marked down when other games have.

For most games lacking multiplayer until a post launch release, have frame rate dips, and texture pop-ins would normally be enough for it to not get a perfect 10. While I think GTA V is a good game (at least based on what I've seen, having not played it yet) I don't think it is 10 worthy, more like a 9.5 or a 9, at least with the current lack of multiplayer, and before a patch comes around and fixes some of the frame rate issues.

I already had the Police running in fences and Walls and killing normal people or killing them selves.

The game is awesome but its not perfect and a Game that doesn't even have Multiplayer on Release is not a Masterpiece.

They didn't even say anything about the missing Multiplayer that alone should make it a 9/10.",2013-09-18T00:19:01Z,0,0

And they didn't even talk about the AI that is still dumm.

The game deserves a 9/10 but not 10/10, because of missing AA,still bad AI and missing Multiplayer.

i'd rate this game on a non point system as a must buy, however with a point system although the character models are stylized based on how GTA has always been done i'd have to mark it down for not pushing character models and visuals as far as these systems have demonstrated they can go. GOTY based on a point system no, base your decision on popularity / multisystem availability that may just push this one over the top.",2013-09-17T20:18:36Z,0,0

Yeah cool story bro, only San Andreas had customising LONG before Hipster Row 1,2,3 & 4 and was WAY ahead of its time. What does SR IV have over GTA V? NOTHING apart from small quirks which can be achieved in a mod. You can't mod SR IV for underwater diving, hunting, bigger map 16, player online, better physics etc. To all of you just on here to hate fuck off, if you weren't thinking of buying it move on and stop trolling.

Then Rockstar will release it again on PC and next gen consoles making a whole load more sales and a whole lot more money.

Do you not know the name ""Grand Theft Auto""? Obviously the character will be a criminal. Like saying NFS shouldn't have racers or Call Of Duty with Soldiers. And no you're not a street thug. From what i remember no GTA makes you a street thug. The setting changes from each game is vastly different and the characters. The idea you think they change a little is clearly stupid.",2013-09-16T21:13:19Z,0,0

Don't get me wrong, GTA V looks nothing short of amazing, but the '10' on the scale of 1-10 is typically looked at as perfection, which is unattainable. Less of a rating meant to be given out and more of a goal which people should strive for but never expect to achieve.",2013-09-16T19:07:04Z,0,0
