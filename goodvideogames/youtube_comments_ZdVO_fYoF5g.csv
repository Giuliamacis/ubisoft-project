My only gripe is the story - if they were going to do time travel, why not connect this game to a previous title? That way there would have be a much bigger emotional impact to the story. Instead, they just rehashed the same old repeated narrative without any canonical connection to the official timeline. Imagine how crazy it would have been if the gannandorf in this was the same one from a previous Zelda. Would have made a far more intimidating and meaningful advisory",2023-09-13T20:18:29Z,0,0

と、考えるのは私がひねくれているからでしょうか？

もし、ティアーズ オブ ザ キングダムと全く同じ内容の物を、新規IPとして名も無き開発会社が、「先に」出していたとして、

ホライゾンフォビドゥンウェスト
ツシマ
レッドデットリデンプション2
サイバーパンク2077
スカイリム
アサシンクリードヴァルハラ
ウィッチャー3

などの、タイトルと比較され、本当にティアーズ オブ ザ キングダムがビデオゲーム史上最高だと評価されているのでしょうか？


新規IPなら、

グラフィックがショボすぎる。

閑散としていて、寂しい。

移動が長い。

ゲージ管理がダルい。

戦闘がつまらん。

打撃音がカスカスで手ごたえが無い。

祠が無駄に多いだけで面白味がない。

難しい。

町の楽しさがない。

ストーリーが薄い。

ゲームプレイに高揚感が無く、単調で地味。

フレームレートが低すぎて操作性が悪い。

ただの、ミニゲーム、パズル集だ。

など、もっと表面的な内容の批判で、平均点が下がっているはず。


任天堂、ゼルダ、バイアスで、最初から、プレイヤーの前向きなやる気が違い、

例えば、ウルトラハンドなら、

任天堂、「選択肢が多い」

無名の開発会社、「パズルゲームが遊びたい訳ではない」「めんどくさい」

など、同じ事でも、絶対反応に違いが出るはず。


任天堂以外の新規IPなら全く同じ内容でも、みなさんこんなに素直に遊んでいないだろうし、それどころか、遊んでみることすらしていないのではないでしょうか？

ゼルダでなければ、癖の強い、賛否有って当然のタイトルで、

マニア層に受けるのは理解できるが、この内容で万人向けだとは、ちょっと考えられない。


売れるのは良い事だが、売れているから良い物だという同調圧力だけでなく、もっと「良く出来ているがつまらない」、みたいな、健全な、批評、批判をしながら遊ぶべきだと思います。



以上、失礼いたしました。

The way TOTK welcomes creative playstyle is beyond impressive, regardless of whatever permutations/combinations player comes up with its all functional for the most part

Open world traversal in TOTK is such a multi layered action i.e. better than any open world game in existence, it could be its own game

*But the game has so many glaring flaws that wasn't even mentioned here,*

TOTK adds 12 new overworld enemies & 8 new bosses which is very poor in terms of enemy variety & wasn't nearly enough to fill the world properly, the depths probably being the most underwhelming area because there's nothing unique to encounter down there except one Frox enemy. Even the unique dungeon bosses were repeated

Despite the tutorial sky islands being the pinnacle of game design, the rest of the sky islands are essentially samey landmasses & are quite sparse.
Bulk of the sky islands are basically ""bring the stone shrines"" and gacha zonai machine

The temples dont hold a candle to classic Zelda dungeons despite being somewhat better than the divine beasts, some of them were awful in terms of Zelda standards",2023-05-23T05:24:58Z,0,15

The only downside is that it is $70 and that it SHOULD be on more powerful hardware at this point.

It uses the same Hyrule and re-uses assets
Same game as BotW after waiting 6 years
When Ocarina of Time to Skyward Sword were using the same formula
When there are franchises that are literally the same games with yearly releases

It blows my mind when they don't think/understand that
It uses the same Hyrule because IT'S A SEQUEL!  IT'S NOT DLC!
If BotW was a masterpiece, WHY CHANGE IT!?
If you want an OoT game, there will be alternate games if you demand that!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdVO_fYoF5g,The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Review,2023-05-11T12:00:22Z,@MahoganyBlack,Now this is a video game. There’s no other game out there with this level of creative freedom and interactivity all on a handheld system that’s drastically underpowered compared to its competitors?! Especially when other games have a hard time releasing without a technical hiccup or two. The creatives at Nintendo are geniuses! Can’t imagine what they could do on a PS5 or a souped up PC 😵,2023-05-11T19:34:31Z,0,0

Its laziness around voice over but im guessing its due to storage or something they cut back. When you compare price tag to RDR2...this falls below par for low performance game. We needed it on switch pro with rdr2 graphics and spoken voice overs and then it would be a 10. Im sure the gameplay element is a 10 but overall in all departments it should be lower. We seem to rate zelda way too high and let the devs off like there is nothing they can improve on.,2023-05-11T17:19:16Z,1,0
