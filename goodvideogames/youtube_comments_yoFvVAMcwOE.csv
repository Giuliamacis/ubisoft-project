My only contribution to this great piece of work, would be considering adapting some of the sound effects (gun fire)that made western movies famous in the golden ages of Hollywood. Watching movies made by SERGIO LEONE (Spaghetti Western Producer) would give you a hint of core effects noticeably missing in RDR2. Bar tension scenarios, focused sound effects for specific Characters. What makes movies last forever in some cases are originality in significant material been used to elevate the experience. Recent Star Wars movies suffers from that in the case of the missing original sound of a storm troppers blaster, who in their minds as a sound director does that?.

The game is severely clunky, horses hitting trees, trying avoid people in the street, to having to walk in almost every zone when the your playing the game at an intense pace.

 also gameplay and story is really strung out, relies far to heavily on the same ol story mission pattern. Extremely frustrating when it come to a climax but then your left wanting to execute your finish, only to see thw story drag on again.

Huge job to compile all the voice overs and play the story through but it just is not compelling enough to make you feel satisfied.",2020-02-24T10:19:34Z,0,2

Controllers have auto aim essentially giving them an aimbot while mouse & keyboard does not. I put in a ticket with Rockstar about this. Here is the response I got:

===============================
Hello,

Thank you for your reply.

We understand your concern regarding the auto-aim not working while using a Keyboard and mouse. We like to inform you that it was as per intended for the keyboard and mouse you can use the controller for the auto-aim. we appreciate your understanding in this regarding.

If you have any other issues please let us know.
Best regards,
Valek N.
Rockstar Support

==============================
Essentially, controller users have a HUGE advantage over you in online mode. They tried to tell me I could turn off ""auto aim"" to join instances of other users who aren't using them. That was a lie.

Auto aim users can lock onto you through bushes, shrubs, trees and the like and shoot you in the head making online play for keyboard and mouse users completely broken in PVP.

However, I found the single player experience to be triple A and would recommend buying the standard version and just skipping the online.",2019-12-09T07:11:48Z,0,1

I stopped playing in the hopes Rockstar would eventually fix the issue, but alas they have not. 
Digital Foundry have spoken about it too and they were also surprised it was never fixed.

I just had so many problems with the game. The pacing was so painfully slow I wanted to give up multiple times, the realism is just ridiculous how you have to constantly worry about all you bars, it takes forever to loot, and “fast” travel is a joke because 1 you have to manually travel to a place to do it and 2 you can’t do it if you have any bounty. I once travelled for 15 minutes to get to a mission that was literally just a 1 minute cutscene, traveled to a mission that disappeared for no reason, and traveled to one that didn’t let me even do it “due to my recent actions” and it didn’t tell me I couldn’t do the mission until I was already there. I’ve literally seen better controls it decade old games. Dead eye should be unlimited cause that’s the only way you’ll hit anything. On a positive note the characters were extremely well written and there were some amazing story moments. But the story still had some major flaws. It’s super predictable what happens if you played the first game and there is absolutely no reason for it to be 60 hrs long. Ok rant over glad I got that off my chest.",2019-05-04T08:37:24Z,0,4

Everyone was saying that the story was going to be roughly 60 hours, but I beat it in 23. I didn't rush through it either, I did a bunch of other side activities such as hunting the legendary fish and catching the legendary fish. I did all the stranger missions when they showed up on the map before I did any story missions. Doing all that plus the story and epilogue only took me 32 hours. I'm not complaining about the game at all, in fact I would put it in my top 3 games. It's just that it all ended so quickly, or at least it felt like it. They could've had you go to Tahiti in the game but somehow you had to go back, or at least you could've explored more of guarma, and maybe they could let you do fishing trips there to catch sharks or huge exotic river fish or something. The game was amazing and I hope the next installment doesn't take as long to make.",2019-04-17T01:32:43Z,5,0

I've been playing it for weeks and it's terrible. Yes the graphics, story and sound are amazing but the gameplay is some of the worst I've ever come across. The shooting mechanics are awful, you spend most of your time reloading after every 2 shots, there are ZERO decent guns in the game, they all feel as much use as throwing sandbags, you can shoot some guy in the chest at point blank range with a so called powerful rifle and he just keeps on shooting. The health and stamina system with all this cores and health bars for both you and separately for your horse is a nightmare and it feels like I'm constantly farting around with the satchel, trying to keep everything topped up. Your horse is a complete nightmare, it runs head first into trees and knocks you off, it panics when your in battle and bucks you off then runs away, it can jump over a 5 ft fence but then falls over a 3 inch boulder, everything feels slow and awkward, you have to walk like a snail through certain places like camps and there's far to many ""follow me at a snails pace"" missions, if you take away the admittedly great presentation of the game, it's a poorly executed and dull open world game that's not even close to be the wonderful game people are making it out to be.

The story was very interesting, the graphics are superb, and there are many things to discover. You can just wander around and do random things, and then get back to your missions whenever you choose to do so.

Another thing I really liked was that if you cannot manage to complete some mission and get killed 2 or 3 times, then the game allows you to skip that small part of the mission and you just continue the game. So basically you never get stuck in the game.",2019-03-10T13:17:54Z,0,7

But when chapter 4 hit, that is when I really started to understand all the characters and I actually started to care for them (Micah being an exception), but all of them had something that was unique and charming about them. When I started to reach the ending (or the false one) I started to get very sad, as I could not handle experiencing this game and not being able to replay it again since I know what happens. However, the false ending of this game was the saddest and most painful art in any video game I have ever played, and while I did not cry of course, it was like my heart was wrenching and opening up in a way that has not happened in a while. This game is the greatest and most immersive game I have ever played in my life, and it FAR surpasses GTA 5 in my opinion, better than any rockstar game before. I hope that GTA 6 will take lessons from this game and provide a experience that cannot be missed",2018-12-30T17:52:21Z,1,1

I will not play another second until rockstar patches the offline replay system. 1 you dont get your gear, your stuck with a lame horse. Im not a hater i enjoy the game, until 1,2, 3 hours go by and im still on certain missions for gold. Thus is massing worldwide as a PROBLEM! Beat it in a week. I try to go back to replay and its not worth the replay. Its NOT WORTH the ONLINE. Rockstar i give a 10/10 for effort. This game didnt last as long as you thought it would for me, and MANY others. I scurry the map for early guns, just to realize when i die (even with the retry from checkpoint  restart) i dont even have them....the replay is why fans are PLAYING! Its not your online, your numbers will support this claim. Restart. Restart. Restart. Restart. Restart. Cant achieve 1 requirement at a time, gotta catch'em all. This isn't pokemon. The controls are what i expected from the last version, but your replay system.

This would allow them to use characters people already love but want to see more of and this provides lots of opportunity to have lots of actual wild west activities when the gang wasn't crazy and caught in the law so much. What could really be great about this if they made a game like this is that they could do a character select system like that in GTA 5 so you cod select between a younger John arthur Dutch maybe hosea bill and Javier as well possibly,2018-11-19T06:53:21Z,0,0

I love how Rockstar encourages such massive world building encompassed with such amazing and interwoven storylines. This is what taking time and putting in the effort results in, This series will probably be the best games you will EVER play in your life!!!

Yo ya estoy en el epilogo y se puede decir que la história base ya la complete: el juego en efecto es muy calmado (no significa que  no tenga accion, tiene y buenisima pero eso es una porcion del juego) y el juego me encanto, yo a diferencia de otros jugadores que les parecio aburrido yo acepte el ritmo del juego, las misiones secundarias las disfrute medianamente si senti que los viajes en caballo se sentian largos pero esto era porque el mapa es inmenso. Tu si te esperabas el clasico humor de gta este no lo tiene porque es algo separado a este, aunque si que tiene este clasico sabor a rockstar , si tu hablas con los npc esntenderas porque. 
El mundo es bello y relajante (otros diran aburrido pero bacio jamas) 

En la historia que me parecio exelente y memorable y que creo que dross no ha llegado a ver por no terminarlo ya que al 75% de la historia de Arthur Morgan es muy lento a diferencia del resto que es exquisito.  Mi proboblema con ese 75% es en efecto la banda balla bola de personajes olvidables no los conoces ni sabes porque estan ahi masque para apoyarce entre si esto si que me molesto ya que hasta el mismisimo dutch nunca entendí porque lo veneraban tanto al punto de creer que los personajes eran ignorantes ya hasta el final les empece a agarrar cariño y se logro desarrollar bien el final y te pone en unas hermosas letras mayusculas la palabra REDENCIÓN y entiendes porque el juego lo tiene en el titulo. Este aspecto haciendolo lo mejor y mi parte favorita del modo historia. 

Algo que si me parecio una patada en las bolas es algo que yo llamó realismo extremo que biene siendo esto de que el caballo se canse,  lastime y muera,  el desgaste de armas y tener que cuidar los nucleos del personaje (comer, dormir ) hasta estar rasurandose cada cuanto.  Como me jodia ir hasta no se donde para reabasteserme de municion (porque no todos los pueblos tiene tienes de armas) 

No hace falta que mencione que el online todavia no sale y dado que el online de gta v me es adctivo yo siendo un nivel 450 en este puede que hasta el modo online de RDR sea el 50% del contenido neto del juego

En fin si logras asimilar el ritmo del juego te parecera como ami una de las mejores experiencias de videojuegos en esta generacion de consolas y eso sin contar el proximo modo online 9.5/10",2018-11-09T04:12:51Z,0,1

RDR1 was so laborious that near the end I had simply quit without finishing, and this one looks to have even more ""fun"" chores. No I don't want to brush my horse, clean my rifle, chop wood, skin animals, or play poker (I'll play poker elsewhere when I want to), I don't care how nice the animations are. That isn't fun. It's as if the game director doesn't do any manual labor in the real world and subconsciously misses it so he mandates it in the virtual world. I barely got through some of the GTA5 boring stuff, and I bet the new GTA will have me mow my lawn as a ""side mission"" or maybe they'll make a VR game where I actually wash dishes..

My only complaint is how incredibly controlling the programming is, limiting your decision to move the character in the way that you please. To me that is a failure in the gameplay. If the gamer wants to sprint they should let them instead of force them to walk just because they don’t want them to run. Also selecting options is a bit annoying. But everything else is phenomenal.

Changed it to a 7.5 or an 8 after playing a bit longer. The story and small details are great, but the story is also just a little too slow burning. Just started chapter 4 after spending 30 hours in the game and it has just started to get slightly exciting. The story is the only thing that is keeping me going. Side activities are already boring. Gunfights don't last very long at all and are far too easy. I don't mind the realistic slow paced gunfights, but at least make them challenging and last more that 2 minutes. Don't get me wrong, I have had alot of fun with this game, but it isn't a game changer like people claim it to be.

At the end I wish we can choose who we play as, I know it doesn’t make sense but I enjoyed playing as Arthur as his voice acting and whole communication with the world is so well done, not saying Marston’s bad at all, I just liked playing the main man.

But Arthur has the best Death in all of gaming, I was literally crying from the last ride before the shootout, the death of “your” horse and he’s death on the cliff. I never cried so much (well Cortana’s death in Halo 4 but that’s cuz I breathe Halo)",2018-10-30T20:47:51Z,0,0

Many other games deserved to be 10 out of 10 (Witcher 3, Halo 4 you could even argue for Skyrim just to name a few) but they weren't because they were not Rockstar games that made you play as criminals.

It seems like the quality control went down at RockstarNorth a bit for this. But at the same time things like hardware improvements, the setting, and the music make it an amazing game to play.
Sometimes the game feels like a 10, other times it feels like a 7.5. I think Daniel Lanois' music and snow physics will make this game seem better than it actually is for years to come. =) 
How many Rockstar games have I played with the exact same systems in place... How many trees murdered my horse!? How many swaths of guys did I hide behind a rock to avoid seemingly random gunshots from, and then peekaboo shoot in the head? How many times did I ride my horse listening to high quality npc voice acting, then kill people, over and over and over again..? And still, I wish the dialogue at the end was better than it was.
 The graphics are both blurry and gorgeous. The sound is ""best ever"" level.

This is literally next gen animations and graphics. I believe rockstar knows what time ps5 comes out and giving us grand theft auto 6 after that, they wanted to maximize realistic efforts with this game to see how we respond because if you don’t remember the owner of rockstar said their goal is to give gta absolute realism. But with that they probs didn’t know how we would respond, (like if it would make it boring). This red dead is the perfect platform to see our response. And just imagine this is graphics for red dead imagine a few years down the line on ps5 (next gta) the graphics and animation/realism the government/news will start to say it is starting to cause a crime rate in real life. This is long so I’ll rap it up.

Bug fixes that i have: unstable map (the map glitches out of place slightly when moving cursor) 

Realism for next gta:
- hair growth for needs to going to barber shop
-weight underweight overweight, needs for gym and eating.
-Gasoline putting in car
-if you are tired you need sleep to be bet shape
-real car interior
-going to jail and bailing out
-relationships etc
Owning and buying houses for single player (with real use) 
Having to bathe for certain events
-Getting rushed to hospital ER when in shootout or wake up in hospital and have to checkout for a cost or go in debt 
-Electric cars (tesla) that you can have auto drive and park for you 
-Upgrade house
-own your own business for extra revenue 
-bringing back working as police, firefighter, ambulance.
-Create your own main character

When your camp has the first party, i gotta say it was probably the first time I've ever sat down and did nothing in a game. I forgot about going on a murdering spree, robbing banks, playing missions, the atmosphere was so amazing for me. I went from dancing along side Dutch, to singing songs, drinking beers around the campfire, and telling stories with Sean, Uncle, Tammy, and some others. Just cracking a cold one open with the boys, if you will. That's what makes this game for me. first game I've actually genuinely cared for other characters.

I would recommend those games to people before I recommended red dead redemption 2, which is a game that only someone who likes rpg games would like. Role playing games are not self-intuitive or user friendly. You actually have to spend a lot of time playing a role playing game to understand how it works if you're not used to role playing games(rpg). I don't like role playing games and red dead redemption hasn't changed that for me. I love video games and I bought it and was willing to give it a shot cause i liked the 1st red dead redemption, but so far i'm probably going to return the game.",2018-10-28T05:32:24Z,0,0

I'd probably say it's about a 6/6.5. In general the story is pretty boring, the gameplay is pretty sluggish and is a total aim assist fest, the graphics seem pretty underwhelming but that's probably down to hardware limitations and Rockstar not releasing the game on PC. And lastly the lands are barren and don't have many fun things to do. Overall I think the game is kinda boring and the graphics on console are that bad that I can't even appreciate them. The resolution is definitely under 1080p on a standard xbox/PS4 the fps is probably around 30fps and everything looks very pix elated which completely ruins the immersion.",2018-10-28T04:46:30Z,4,3

I understand the fact that it will take longer to get to point A to point B when you're riding a house instead of driving a car but in the first red dead the gameplay felt a lot faster and the horses weren't so slow. Almost everything you do feels like it takes forever. Even when you push down on the buttons on the controller theirs sometimes a loading icon.

I've had a lot of bugs show up, most of my playtime has been spend traveling from A to B because Rockstar wants to be ""realistic"" with the fast travel system on the map (seriously why isn't there no way to fast travel TO your camp?

I don't deny that the story is 60 hours long. But the problem is that most of that time has been padding, not to mention the actual missions fall into the same hand-holdy trap as so many previous Rockstar games in the past.

I'm willing to bet that it was given a 10/10 out of fear. Because I've seen the responses from websites that have given the game a 9 or lower (A 9 is still an amazing score) and the reviewers have received death threats from crazy fans. One even had his address dropped online in a scare tactic to make him change his score.",2018-10-28T02:11:23Z,0,0

So RDR2 is amazing but there is one tiny flaw, as I was playing I saw some one using a electronic fan in their house. I did some research, electrical fans were talked about in 1902 and brought out in 1905 and as you say the game is based in 1899 so I had a look around. I found a number of electric trams and one electric car surprisingly, this means that this game is not remotely accurate. For me this is a very big spoiler as it totally ruins the immersion.

The hype will kill this game, review scores be damned. The reality I believe is that your typical consumer who will play it (which will be many) will ultimately remark on it being ambitious if not more memorable and immense if not more fun. I feel like most will tire themselves on it in these coming months, and all those years of effort, millions of dollars spent (on advertising alone), and hundreds of overworked employees will be left a forgotten memory in an aftermath of 'meh'.

Not sure if type is adding 3 to rating.   The setting is rare but still you know other game setting is rare too like origin and far cry 4.  Rating has lost its purpose. It's more  about satisfying fans egos.   It think another system of rating will be made maybe an artificial one. As humans hold emotions and tend to be nestolgic beings.,2018-10-26T04:24:29Z,0,0

A tragic lovestory has never been able to captivate me like this. Not once. Whenever I think about Brokeback Mountain, not only does it hurt emotionally, but physically it hurts too. My throat constricts, I have trouble breathing and tears which I did not know were there well up. It's like a huge chunk of emotion is surfacing from the pit of my stomach and forcing itself through my throat. Never would I have imagined that a fictional story could bewitch me like this, make me feel such strong emotions.
Beautiful scenery, amazing acting and a heartwrenching plot that has touched millions around the world. The English vocabulary is too limited to express accurately what is going through me right now. It's painful but beautiful and I can't help but deliciously torture myself time and time again when I listen to this song. It's like I feel the pain Enis and Jack felt, the mark of a true masterpiece. 
It makes me think of the people who are going through similar heartbreaks. It's terrible that there is still so much hate towards people who aren't heterosexual. Much love and strength to anyone in a similar position. I look forward to the day that we can all be treated as equals.",2018-10-25T21:25:13Z,1,1

IGN's reviewer has failed to analyse the far beneath structure of this game and points at the things that suppose to be criticised! it's a very bland and unprofessional review. I'm not suggesting that this game is bad or don't deserve 10. All im saying is this review feels like coming from someone who wanted to give it 10/10 anyway!

Greatness takes time and the proof is in the pudding. These guys are on another level even if they had delayed it I'm sure they would of had to work long hours to get the complete level of polish this game clearly has. I work in music and I work 20 hour days regularly creative and artistic expression should never have a time limit on it.,2018-10-25T14:18:49Z,2,0

But casuals in the comment sections have told me that if its a high score, that means IGN is biased and this game is probably a 6/10 at best. If IGN gave this a 6/10 then its assuredly a 10/10 because IGN doesn't know how to review stuff.
Oh wait, everyone's agreeing with the review because it aligns with what they wanna hear, but we're not biased at all, amirite gamers?

Yeah, if this game got a 9/10, everyone would scream at their moms and RISE UP, because how dare they give this perfect game I haven't played yet get 1 point below perfection?

It's clunky, but also the game deserves more than just coming across as a random sequel. Heck, it's a prequel to RDR rather than a sequel anyway. I would have thought that Red Dead Revolver -> Red Dead Redemption was setting precedent for a more interesting naming scheme whereby only the first two words are maintained.

Why not Red Dead Revenge? Red Dead Retribution? Red Dead Rebellion? Red Dead Revolution? Or back to Red Dead Revolver. Or just call the titles Red Dead going forward. Jesus, anything really. Red Dead Redemption 2 really sounds pretty crap. 

Here's hoping it's the best game of all time though. Otherwise I'll be pissed that I bought a PS4 Pro this month for it and preordered the special edition.",2018-10-25T09:49:35Z,1,0
