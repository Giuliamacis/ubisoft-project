The entire story and plot development is very well explained up until the ending chapters where it is so implicative in a way that basically just verbally spams a jargon and lexicon of “destiny intertwined with fate”. The annoying part is that there IS reasoning for this, the game just takes a turn in its final moments of not explaining that in a down to earth way.",2024-03-20T12:42:33Z,0,8

Protagonisten und Effekte sind Bombe und da hörts dann auch schon auf. Holzstapel und Heuballen sehen aus wie aus der PS2 Ära. Felsen sind teilweise nur Pixelhaufen und Objekte in Läden haben fast gar keine Texturen und sind massiv kantig. Auch Objekte wie Blumen, tauchen ca. 2 Meter vorm Charakter erst auf und deren Schatten, wenn überhaupt vorhanden ebenso.
Viele Objekte haben eine massiv verwaschene Texturierung.
Der Hintergrund wie Berge in der Ferne wird oft auf einen ""Pixelmatschhaufen"" reduziert.
Die Umgebungen wirken oft ""statisch"" und ""tot"" sobald man stehen bleibt, wenn keine NPCs auf der Karte wären.
Die Ausleuchtung wirkt unecht und vielerorts schlecht schattiert und schwankt von ""zu dunkel"" bis ""zu hell"" wenn man Gebäude betritt oder verlässt.
