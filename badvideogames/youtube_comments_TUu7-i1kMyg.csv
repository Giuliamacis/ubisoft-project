""More quests"" said no sane gamer with a job these days after playing a handful of games of the same type. Better and more enjoyable content, absolutely, but it's mostly always the same and it starts to appear lifeless even though the graphics are at the state of the art. And it makes sense when developers say that it's not just the (already terrible) churn, but now the churn or promotion of the inexperienced. It shows. I admit from 1990s to 2000s I was naive and played for graphics. But the bar for impressive graphics has become insanely high while acceptable graphics are now common but the (AAA) industry fails even more at delivering good stories.

At least with Square Enix's Final Fantasy games they still create aesthetically beautiful characters, because they appreciate that we appreciate how stunning they are to look at.
Even TV shows become unwatchable because of embracing wokeness... Netflix lost me in a few shows I used to watch because they decided to jump headfirst into the woke club, sacrificing great content for 'diversity' and 'inclusion., ie, how The Witcher butchered the books by changing the characters.

People have been anticipating a Assassins Creed game about Japanese Ninja since the end of the first game.   We finally get an Assassins Creed game set in Japan.

yes you can say whatever you want
freedom of speech and democracy have allowed it.
what these two haven't allowed, is physical violence, but if somebody is offended by your words, that is indirect violence, because they could just not listen to you, while physical violence is direct aggression that can harm another person. 
a vulgar vocabulary or one that goes against all these protections towards certain subjects like immigration, gender disparity and so on and so forth, shouldn't have criminal charges, because freedom of speech is also to express what you hate, otherwise democracy transforms into fascism, since any opinion that goes against the government's ones is punishable.

There is nothing with showing this black samurai as he existed in history but why make him something he was not. Make him a side character, maybe a friend of the protagonist in some way. But for the protagonist to be him? Mega stupid and mega offensive. If they want to have more games with Africans in them then set the damned game in Africa. Make a historically authentic character and plot, set amongst one of the kingdoms of Africa. Make it uncompromising and real.

What would you do? Make better dishes? Maybe change the concept of the place? Ask the customers what they dont like about the food? NO, of course not. Just blame them for having high standards when they're paying with time and money to have your shit, Ignore their opinion and keep trying to sell the same trash food, right??? Yall from ubisoft management are retarded or what.

If you think that corporations like this give a single fuck about us, you are the one with issues. All they want is money and they will keep acting monkeys till they break. Honestly, they deserve it, Ubisoft manages to be SO BAD that its even a meme. They being bullied and going down to the bottom is life humbling them, is the only way they gon learn. Karma hits hard and I hope it hits them harder. Ruining HUGE titles, and talking like we the problem? Yall stupid. Dont listen then and drown at the beach Idgaf. 

If I ever feel like I wanna play a Ubisoft game (which is almost impossible to happen) Ill pirate it all the way. They dont deserve a single penny for this lazy ass job.

It's a fucking videogame! It's not real life! It's something to ease your mind after a hard day at work! Welcome to 2024, which at some point will be remembered in the annals of History as the ""Offended Age"". UBISOFT is a company that has been doing its shit since way before many of you were even born. Does it mean they are flawless? No, but it does mean that they know a tad bit more about the videogaming industry than many of you, because... well, because they're one of the most successful and paramount companies in the bizz. Unless you live in lalaland, yes, that does matter, they helped write the rules book, they have contributed massively to popular culture, whereas you lot... You keep doing your offended, moaning business and let Ubisoft do its business, that's the natural order of things.

If you want to talk about legitimacy and relevance, let's talk about the ethnic cleansing perpetrated by Israel and that has been taking place for the past 1+ year in the Middle East or the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Now THAT is illegitimate and relevant. If a videogame makes you question legitimacy and relevance instead of fun and accomplishment and socializing, you surely are a miserable person.",2024-10-15T10:33:11Z,0,0

The only truth ubisoft has spouted in recent years is that gamers don't own their software. Because the legal implications of ownership of digital media would literally destroy the digital industry, and people who say licenses are bad don't know why licenses exist in the first place. Saying we should legally own our games is like saying the farmer should give his food away for free because he's got plenty.

Something I loved video games taught me something about real history that I would never get from a book. History was one of my worst subjects. Granted not everything was accurate but at least 80% was. The entire purpose of these games was educational but entertaining. Being an Assassin in a point in  time of history telling there story while educating the player on the era which they are playing. That was Assassin's Creed. I became so in love with this game that I decided that I would visit each location generally that each character played in. All the way to Origins in Egypt. Each time the amount of knowledge I learnt through the game and my own researched decreased. This turned one of my favorite memories and hobbies into something I felt lost itself in.

Ahem *Clears throat*

First of all @Legendary Drops :

Stop being an ass, Hiroshima was leveled because it had the majority of the Japanese invasion force there, if it wasn't bombed. The US would've lost Hawaii. So for the idiot American you are, better check your facts first. As for Nagasaki, it existed since the time of the samurai. No one cares about the excuses and therefore many manga and anime in Japan along with their trades have finally suffered in the long run even after Covid, by Japan remarking this. It is also the only country where you are looked down on if you cannot speak Japanese. 

English is seen as a lower class language. You people still have no idea how many in Japan still look down on others, even prior to WWII. Also the Japanese goverment is highly corrupt. And the people are as dumb as those in the States. Believing everything your leaders tell you. Here is an interesting fact: The United States poverty and problematics are equal to that of Japan. They both might show on paper a huge recovery, but that is just on paper. 

As for Shadows, you are talking submissive. Making me believe something here went wrong with your creation. Secondly and you are not gonna like this. I pre-ordered the game.
Because IT IS A LL FICTION. And if you complaining Youtubers crying for attention about various topics for more views didn't whine all the time while also snorting coke from a history book, games would've been great already. But right now you are following the Woke Agenda as usual and turning every legendary title into a game for total wimps and douchebags. Congrats because you guys are the reason this game Shadows is not comming. 

Also, back to Japan, why should i take it serious? VS Russia when Ukraine was invaded did they help? When Covid spread over the rest of the world did they assist with anything. And how about NATO its issues with China? Haven't seen them doing a thing. Maybe wake up and know. That if they want to have a say snap them back to reality and contribute in the world effort. They are a country and not a bloody dystopia .

I just dont think being a black Japanese samurai is very immersive or relatable.

Its like and this is a funny example vut true, playing as a duck in goat simulator, or being a police officer in GTA, im sorry but it just does not make sense and i dont like it, not because im racist but because every time i try to get invested in the story i realize how much of it does not make sense.

I cant play a game which i can't understand and to understand something you gotta be able to relate in some way and a way to do that isnt being a samurai listening to rap music that just completely craps on the culture and history in the process.

Its like im not sexist but i know the cover of assassins creed spartan, was a dued on the cover what all of a sudden is every character either a female or black?

Like i can understand an Egyptian character being black makes sense tight, but a Japanese character?

It like you cant even keep the cover of your games authentic ti your canon story like if Kassandra was supposed to be cannon why do you have a guy on the cover?

Things just dont add up and it completely ruined Valhalla, it completely ruined the Spartan ac the only one ive even remotely liked recently was the one vased in Egypt because at least that somewhat made sense",2024-10-09T14:23:07Z,1,0

The only reason they exist is because we keep purchasing their crap... I'm speaking collectively. I spend my time and money where I can be entertained the way I want. It's a taste on the marginalized outskirts, but it delivers and I'm pretty happy with that and I put my money where my mouth is.

Why do people just keep sucking down what's coming down the pipe... Enough people like them. And maybe that's just what they need and  want. 

So in conclusion is that these games aren't for you. And you're scathing review is yours to give. That's okay too. But Don't elevate yourself and think that they don't have to make a game for you. And if what they do is enough for them, and enough of the fan base, then they're just going to keep doing it. It makes for good bitch session material. They don't have to satisfy everybody.

Just yesterday I finished Saints Row The Third, and that was my first time trying a game from the franchise. It was SO REFRESHING! Men were masculine men and women were feminine women. You can run over, shoot, punch, etc. EVERYONE in the game, regardless of their sex or race, and they'd punch you back. The jokes were direct and unabashed. The weapons were raw and visceral, and the missions were completely bonkers. Games aimed at the male audience MUST be handled BY BASED, MALE DEVELOPERS AND WRITERS. Period. As soon as women or woke soyboys start developing these games, the quality goes down tremendously, and everything turns a lot less fun. And, no, it's not that I ""only"" like ""toxic masculinity games"". Even Mario and Kirby games are AMAZING to me. Wokeness is an entirely different thing. What's horrible about this is that wokeness is WEAKNESS. Nobody expects Mario to behave like Doomguy, because he is clearly a caricature. Mario is not super masculine or anything, but what's important is that HE IS NOT A WEAK, EASILY-TRIGGERED, MENTALLY-ILL, CONFUSED AND BRAINWASHED SLOB WITH NO BACKBONE either. That's what's wrong with wokeness. Oh, and Princess Peach is a normal cartoon girl, nothing bad in that. She is not a completely unrelatable, insufferable, narcissistic, disagreeable, heartless, spineless, bitter, misandrist bitch void of empathy towards anyone but herself, who magically got all her power just from being born with a vagina, like 100% of all modern ""female heroes"" we've been bombarded with since wokeness became a thing.

Incorrect inflections, incorrect tone over emails/texts, ""how often do you say retarded"". It feels like the crabs-in-a-bucket metaphor where everyone is so ready to tear eachother down over nothing. 

Actually arguing for ""people are people"" and that everyone deserves a shot equally is somehow..bad? 

Not really all that relevant, but as someone on the spectrum..this kind of constant biting at other people over intentions and tone is frustrating to the point of nausea. What the hell?? This feels like it shouldn't be normal at all but it feels like it's millions of people all doing this and not even batting an eye. 

Talking anywhere online is exhausting. 

As for being on-topic with Yasuke and AC: Shadows..the tokenization of not only Yasuke as a person but Japanese culture as nothing more than ""Pretty asian stuff""..it sucks. AC: Shadows had a good story right there. A servant to a Samurai, that samurai is killed by this ninja, compelled to carry that legacy. It could have been so easy to write a compelling story of perserverance in a completely different culture and thriving in it. But no. Hip-hop, cheap ""mall-ninja"" cosplay levels of attention to details, its just offensively boring...

I couldn't agree more.  It's baffling and it's been going on for a quite some time.  My sister works for a company that makes educational videos, regardless, their HR director, who we believe takes orders from a board of executives that believe it's important to buy-in 100% with all these trends.  So...to make sure they head off all the inevitable disasters of previous cultures and lost civilizations who weren't careful with addressing one another informally, they decided to make a rule that you cannot collectively refer to any group of employees as ""guys.""  For some reason, talking about all these stupid mofos who believe in this shit makes me really pissed.  All this shit is disingenuous, manipulative and isn't how healthy people communicate.  It's my opinion that it's fucking up these young generations, cuz after all when you beat these kind of stupid creeds in to kids minds and you do it repeatedly, you can't change your practices/ideologies later and try to brainwash the kids in a different direction.   Teaching people that your feelings shouldn't be hurt or that having obsessively thins skin about things like pronouns and making sure you tattle tale to your HR department instead of handling it yourself.  It has made this society in to a bunch of fucking pussies, or, actually when I was growing up it was acceptable to say Quit being a fucking fag and grow a pair!  If that hurt your feelings, then we'd proved our point.
      With regard to the word ""retard,"" we need to have the definition formally changed.  In my lifetime, neither me nor anyone I was friends with ever used that word to describe someone who had struggles with their mental or physical development.  That's really cruel and fucked up.  Retard, it is my opinion, is used when rational adults are referring to a human being, who was willfully and deliberately done or said something so proudly stupid and baffling to onlookers that onlookers and people hearing the story all agree, that individual is retarded.  The person in question just goes about their business being retarded without being aware of it because it's what they are.  Like the dude I saw in the grocery store the other day and was testing out toothpicks and returning them to the box.  Or the girl that called the deli I worked at in college and to order a BLT for delivery.  She asked me if it came with bacon and I explained what BLT stands for.  I asked if she wanted the 8"" or footlong and she asked which one was bigger...
     The rules for all this shit were laid out a long time ago and don't need to be changed, nothing will come from that.  But some asses do need to be beat, but those people will get their comeupance in due time.  Don't be vulgar in front of kids.  Be polite.  Err on the side of caution and be repectful of people you don't know that well.  Don't be a jackass, especially in public.  Be aware of other people's feelings BUT THAT IS AS FAR AS YOU NEED TO GO WITH OTHER PEOPLE's FEELINGS.  Psychologists will tell you, other people's feelings don't belong to you.

But you are going to say ‚ÄúBut Last samurai is literally a movie about a white saviour‚Äù but except that story is based on a true story although guy was french not an American. Yasuke in this game however is entirely based on speculations and some random guy‚Äôs imagination .These people tries so hard to be not racist they ended up doing a full circle and became racists",2024-10-05T15:41:36Z,1,0

Outside of echo chambers and clickbait articles (and videos like this btw) everyone is hyped to fuck. We are all so excited for this game is looks amazing. The idea of 2 chars, one being tanky, one being ninja, so you got best of both worlds and can switch things up more, not to mention how great it looks.

I haven't spoken to a single non-neckbeard who isn't hyped.

""We have that many people that share our opinions"" yeah because people who click on these sort of videos for validation get into echo chambers and the algorithm pins em in to the same sort of stuff, which reinforces the beliefs. It'd an unironic skinner meme ""are my phony culture wars not actually based in reality, it's just a trillion dollar company pushing me into anger and hate because that gets the most clicks ?"" ""no, it's the devs that are wrong"".

I clicked on this because now and again this sort of bollocks shows on my feed (and now I've engaged it's gonna be bad for a few weeks, which is super annoying, even if I downvote) and I'm wondering where people stand. And it's the same shit. It's been the same shit since the internet began. You've got more clever with your language and terms, you dress it up nicely, you try to sound more academic, but at the end of the day, if it was a white dude instead of a black dude, y'all be lauding it for telling an interesting story while introducing something ""us westerners can really resonate with"". It'd be laughable if it wasn't so dangerous,

I remember taking my biracial niece to see the little mermaid. Seen so many young'uns in there. Light skin, dark skin, black kids, all saying same thing ""someone who finally looks like me"".

All you're being asked is to make it better for people who had less opportunities than you. You're like spoilt rich kids who inherited some mega hotel, and are refusing to put in accessibility options, because ""why should I, this is my business, if they can't get in that's on them not me, I'm successful without them and frankly I don't even want to see them here""",2024-10-04T06:30:46Z,0,1

The problem with leftists is that they think they operate on a moral highground.

They dont think they need to listen to you because you are inferior in their mind. They will never take the self awareness pill if it comes from the hand of someone they look down on.

Little do they realise, their sense of virtue is entirely predicated on their cultural conditioning. They come from the most extreme guilt/innocent cultures in history (it is ehat we are right now in the west).

in AC Shadow, the fact that Yasuke is black make me mad, not because i'm racist but because Ubisoft use black people for their woke propaganda 

is the reason i loved Ghost of Tsushima, because this game trully respected japanese culture with a lot of good male and female characters, personnaly i loved Yuna's character she is a strong woman in the game and she is wrote correctly

we all love black or female characters in video games when they are wrote correctly, but Ubisoft (and many video games studio) use black people or women just because their skins or sexual orientations

for Ubi, who is the character of our next games placed in feudal japan? yeah Yasuke you know because he's black it's great to show to our players inclusivity in 17th century 

it's just because he's black, whatever the reasons or excuses give by Ubisoft, they are so obssesed with their woke mentality and their hate of white male population, they don't care about historical accuracy since AC Origins. only matter for them skin color or sexual orientation

i say that because a lot of Ubisoft developers are liberal female trully hating white male, nothing happen with no reason, in the trailer the fact that white japanese people bow to a black man, the idea made them wet in their panties, i trully believe that 

i think if Naroe was the only playable character, we all agreeing to play the game with a female character but their mentality make me really sick, they are the most racist people in the room behind their fake good intentions

1.- Ditching Assassin's Creed original ending (thus forcing the writer to change his original vision) to milk the franchise. This happened somewhere in 2009, before AC: Brotherhood.

2.- Rushing their games so they could release one per year.

3.- The creation of their launcher/store, in a world full of third-party launchers nobody wants.

4.- The CEO's flawed vision of ""Gamers are not yet ready for AAAA games"".

World building and architecture etc can be worked on up to release. But the story cannot be changed without a full rewrite and a lot of time. Cos then you aren't just making new models, dragging them in place of the old ones, but you're re writing the story.

They could have combined what made watch dogs 1 & 2 good and we would have had a great follow up instead of the empty & boring disaster that was Legion. They keep trying to release AC games every year or two, instead they should take at least a four year break for the next game in order to release a truly fantastic game like they've done multiple times before. But what annoys me the most is the wasted talent, they could have made a masterclass out of star wars, skull&bones and AC Shadows but they had to push their own agenda and seek rapid profit for investors and whatnot. I just feel like at this point the company should just stop and sale the franchises to other studios much more respectful of their gamers.

Its all LIES, the reason the game is GARBAGE is because of Ubisoft's IDIOTIC ideals and their willingness to LIE, TWIST and MAKE UP entire Japanese history with ZERO regard to ACTUAL Japanese culture. I mean when JAPAN ITSELF says it could become an international incident, then you SHOULD LISTEN AND CHANGE. EVERYTHING Ubisoft took ""inspiration"" from for Yasuke was written by a WHITE professor in japan who MADE IT ALL UP just to sell books. NONE of it is based on ACTUAL historical documents OTHER than the fact that there WAS a black man in japan named Yasuke who worked for Nobunaga. Other than that, ITS ALL LIES AND MADE UP. He was NEVER a samurai, he DID NOT play ANY kind of ""pivotal"" role in Japanese history or battle. If they wanted to have a black samurai, THEN THEY SHOULD have created a FICTIONAL character rather than using actual historical people. They SHOULD have simply created a FICTIONAL character who was a Black man and a member of the Assassin's brotherhood from Europe or even better a part of the original group in Africa established by Bayek, who travels to Japan in search of a piece of Eden and who becomes or disguises himself as a Samurai to make connections with Nobunaga and enlist other famous Samurai and Shinobi to the Brotherhood (just like Basim did with the Vikings in AC Valhalla). That would have been PERFECTLY FINE and even BETTER than what they have now and would have made PERFECT SENSE in the context of the overarching Assassins Creed storyline. It would have created a fictional character they could take ANY liberties they wanted to with, AND would have explained WHY a Black Man would have been in Japan during that time period to begin with. It would have waved away WHY there would have been little to no historical writing about him and could have EVEN played up why the writings about Yasuke that we do have are so scarce in real life. That he was part of the Infamous Assassin Brotherhood and made it a point to NOT be noticed and for people to not know who he really was and very few people even knew about him. It would have created this ""Mysterious figure"" that seemingly came from nowhere, done all these amazing things and then ""Vanished into history with few daring to mention his name"" sort of feel to it. NOW I WOULD PLAY THAT GAME!!! The MAIN issue continues to be Ubisoft taking actual people and turning them into something they NEVER WERE and NOT respecting Japanese culture and history.",2024-10-02T18:52:38Z,0,0

After seeing that video from the SBI employee saying things need to burn to the ground...it's a matter of fact they create this and many other media with hate as part of their purpose, cuz if things were just to be inclusive you will get Creed (the film) or DA Inquisition heck even the 1st Horizon where you have diverse characters and new minority leads but not at the price of old characters or the story itself. Heck I as a mid level known Tolkien reader could write a Bible to a Second Age Tale that A) Talks a helluva lot of Colonialism but B) Keeps Tolkien known facts and doesn't change named characters paths massively. They cannot be as stupid as not to be able to do that time and time again, as a matter of fact we know they would repeat that in Star Wars for example. They created a highly divisive entrance then tried to keep the IP alive and the moment they got Grogu and were sure that Grogu works as a product they retraced each and everyone of their steps. 

They brought the hate to the game, to the movies, to media in general and we need to find a new and better strategy to fight them back. I honestly don't know how yet but we have to.",2024-10-02T18:50:05Z,0,0

Is innnot simpler for them to just make the game time period-respectful and accurate and avoid the controversy?
Instead of having to align with news outlets to brush off the hate and call us gamers racists/mysoginist?

Happened with EA.  I always played battlefield games, since they released battlefield V and their president called us misogynistic pigs for calling out how wildly historically innacurate a women army squad captain in WW2 was, right after they had said it was going to be their most realistic WW2 to date.
Not only didn‚Äôt I played the game, I rejected EA forever.
Oh you insult me? Fine I‚Äôm not going to give MY MONEY to YOU anymore.

Same with Ubisoft, fuck your I‚Äôm not giving you money anymore.

Do they not read the audience?
80% of the gamers don‚Äôt want this forced nonsensical inclusion shit.

They don‚Äôt know the difference with us liking variety in character creation screens but not in forced characters.

When a game lets you do your own character, we want everyone to be able to enjoy the game how they want, I don‚Äôt care if some gender fluid Femboy in Los Angeles wants to play as very tall lady with rainbow colored hair and loads of make up on a single player gritty dark medieval fantasy RPG.

Let the boy/girl live whatever fantasy he wishes too.

Someone elsewhere might want to play as a lizard with wolf face and I can still make myself a human warrior than looks fitting to the world. Their immersion isn‚Äôt at the cost of mine.

But when you are making a pre-defined character that players have to use, you have to think about the setting and historical accuracy or at least most likely historical accuracy.

For example if it‚Äôs medieval age like and it‚Äôs a human warrior, then a big male. Because men are much stronger than woman and warriors where men because of this. If it‚Äôs fantasy race wouldn‚Äôt matter in this case,  but gender does because of the whole strength and sex thing.

If it‚Äôs other race like elves or reptiles gender doesn‚Äôt matters.

But making a samurai game where we are forced to play as a female when everyone who knows Japan, knows how submissive the role of the woman has been in this country since forever, still pretty much to this date they are way less advanced in that term than the rest of the world.

Or a black man when there was only 1 black samurai in their whole story and he didn‚Äôt made anything but exist.
Nothing interesting to his story but the mere fact of being black.",2024-10-02T08:18:00Z,0,0

I‚Äôm for diversity and people making whatever kind of game they want.

Ubisoft sucks for many other reasons, but having a black character isnt it. Idk when video game youtubers started talking about inclusivity. If the game sucks, the game sucks. Also, if being positive and being woke is so bad for video games, then why are so many good games still coming out? Larian Studio is ""woke"" and Baulders gate 3 is GOTY. Sooo???? 
I hope Ubisoft dies because of Skull and Bones. For making shitty buggy games and micro transaction garbage. Not for making a historical fiction game with a character with darker skin than the average weeb. Theres a big difference between Giant enemy crab and just someone who may or may not have existed.

Yall wanna complain about the environment art being of the wrong period or location, then i agree that does sound valid, but shut up about by yasuke.

You fight medusa in AC Greece. Niccolo Machiavelli an assassin leader in the Ezio games. Neither of these are real things. There are aliens and ancient civs in this universe.

Assassin's Creed has never been, and never will be, fully historically accurate.

Maybe I‚Äôm the one overthinking this, but it feels like no one is able to see through these double standards.

1. Turn AC into a full historical epic series. Something which could be used in college history classes unironically. The immersion is by far the best and most unique part of AC. I can walk around Odyssey's map for hours despite it not being R* level detailed.
2. Abandon the preachy woke stuff. Fire Sweet Baby Inc, acknowledge their mistakes in this area, be transparent with fans about how it won't happen again.
3. Do a complete 180 degree turn on the game release side of things. Make all DLC free from the start, stop yearly releases. If this requires compromise in employment then so be it.",2024-10-01T10:28:52Z,0,0

And not atrocious monetization schemes, garbage world/level design, repetitive, safe similar gameplay over multiple games, bland artistic direction that ruin them? Like comon games can be litteraly ""woke"" like baldur's gate 3 but as long as it's a freaking great game, they just love it, even though people in the game are gay, lesbian, trans or even zoophiles, the game has awesome gameplay, great world design and a great story, we only need that, no matter the ideas or morality the game is trying to push. Because yeah every game has political undertone and it's fine. Batman has a lot of right wing esthetics and morality but most leftist people will play it because it's great, and it widens their view on the world, the oposite is true, lots of right wingers played BG3 even though it's very progressive. So the problem isn't agenda or wokeness or not having sex idols as protags, it's just having garbage games made by a company that destroyed itself for profit and run by people who don't understand what human creativity and interactions are.",2024-10-01T10:07:57Z,0,0

For the last decade they've just been butchering their own games, which causes them to flop. Then when the players give them feedback and critisizm and tell them why it's not succsessful, they buy articles, bot comments and go on an all out war against their potential clients. And they lie not only to the clients but to their investors as well. And the complaints are more than valid, the forced wokeness aside, this specific game is wildly inaccurate historically and it's extremely low effort on the design and ironically is set in a nation where the people care deeply about their history and traditions. To top it all off, their previous flopped titles - star wars and the first ever quadruple A pile of dogshit were beyond terrible when it comes to gameplay and technical issues. Look i've never liked ubisoft or their games, even back in the 2000-2010's but this is just a disgrace. Ever since AC 1 people have wanted to see a japanese AC, hell even I who strongly dislike AC was kind of excited to see what it's gonna be, it's a match made in heaven, the biggest stealth game about assassins and the nation of ninjas. And they just shit in Yasuke the retainer, give him Zoro's sword from One piece and surround him with chinese buildings. For fuck sake.",2024-09-30T22:24:43Z,0,2

If you have a problem with people questioning words you say (which mind you there are words that are hurtful to people for one reason or another). Why can't you challenge your vocabulary level and find different words that are more descriptive of the problem or the issue you have instead of a jump to word that you have settled on because of your generation. I'm your generation as well and I understand both sides. However if I'm going to potentially make someone feel uncomfortable by a word I say, (and have prior knowledge that the word I'm using is more common to be a insulting word to a certain demographic) I will avoid saying that word and use my education of the English vocabulary to find different words and break those ""generational habits"". It used to be okay a generation back from mine to have your child go pick a willow branch and get whipped by it... in no way is that okay or should it have been... but that was during that generation...

I'd just rather decide for myself if my outrage is warranted, because so many want to provoke it these days and I refuse to feed them.

Let's not forget, Emojis are a medium for expressing yourself and now, where you can put race and other things on emojis, I think there's room for it to get pretty ugly if people want it to. 
Like if a racist is hiding behind emojis to taunt or talk about colleagues they don't like, I get why they'd wind up fired ""over emojis"".

Does the game have some flaws for sure the latest season update is buggy and hit detection was a bit better before but I think they fucked it up this last season update I can't lie it's going down hill a bit but hit detection has always been an issue in so many fps's games but it's better then what cod has put out in the last 5-6 years all there games launch as a buggy mess way worse then xdefient. Xdefient has little bugs that they iron out pretty quickly generally. have you seen bo6 if you think xdefient is bad take a look at cod lol. the other games though I 100% agree with xdefient could be doing better for sure but I have about 200+ hours on the game and it's fun its flawed and could be improved on for sure I agree on that but compared to outlaws and the new assassins creed there not comparable lol.,2024-09-30T07:09:03Z,0,0

I have two teenage children who are dual citizens and spent half their childhood there.  I lived in Nara, Osaka, and Kyoto, where at least part of AC Shadows is supposed to take place.  I actually worked in Morinomiya for a few years, literally across the street from the grounds of Osaka Castle.  The Torii isn't just a gate to Shinto shrines, it's the symbol of the religion itself.  It's like the Cross for Christianity, the Star of David for Judaism, or the Crescent for Islam.  While they don't expect it of tourists, as a resident I was expected to remove my hat when I walked underneath them. In addition to Shinto shrines, they are erected in places of great sentimental importance, like around schools to protect their children, or cemeteries to comfort the souls of their loved ones.  The one pictured isn't just a monument, it's a memorial.  They wouldn't have left it broken unless it had staggering sentimental meaning. 
The vast majority of Japanese people I talked to said they didn't mind foreigners depicting their culture, many adding they considered it a compliment, as long as it was done respectfully.  One of my bosses that had studied in the US said, ""It doesn't have to be perfect, but it should at least appear like you tried.   We are more than willing to give you an E for effort.""  I think that's the same Torii that was depicted in the beginning of 'The Wolverine,' which started in a flashback to Nagasaki the day it was destroyed.  Most of the locals I talked to about the film had mixed feelings about the beginning, and were quick to point out what the filmmakers got wrong, but had a positive overall view of the film because you could tell the filmmakers tried to be respectful.  I'm not sure Ubisoft was using that very gate as a reference, but to use any broken Torii to prop up cartoonish characters shows a lot of ignorance and disrespect, and I think most people know respect is a pretty big deal in Japanese culture.",2024-09-30T02:42:17Z,4,143

I quit my job because I couldn't take it any more.

I questioned it and kept questioning it.
""The right thing that you are talking about is not what the gamers wants, it is actually what no one wants.""

I was left out of meetings more frequently, decisions were made without me, my work was slowly being scrapped/replaced.

Companies trying to be kind and inclusive is a good thing in my eyes.  I don't think people with good intentions making mistakes is the worst thing you can do.

Also do Ubisoft even have any shooter games ? I have The Division but that was not really a shooter game. The amount of ammo it took to spray out and reload to take out mobs like gangsters who run with baseball pats with t-shirts as armor take some insane amount of shooting while one kick from the pat takes the player down on knees.  I get it when it be some aliens with ironman suits that your typical modern warfare weapons need to spray out a lot of ammo to do any damage but all the bots are single shot or just blow air at you and your down.

It doesn't make sense, if automotive, industrial, agricultural are held to the standards of if it's not working when sold you pay a fine and get sued, why isn't the entertainment? These companies should be held liable when the products don't work, instead we give them a year or two or three to figure it out? To patch it out? After spending that initial $100 the game works 100% as intended 3 years later.. when the game now costs $20.. maybe 9.99 on a steam sale.",2024-09-29T14:34:10Z,0,0

And that is what freedom of speech is. When some claims that you offended them they're wrong by default as well. It is their feelings of being offended not the other way around. Forcing people to ""watch their words"" is essentially banning that freedom of speech and voicing your opinions.

""Modern audience"" should learn to work with their feelings and how to lead a constructive debate rather than being infantile soft babies that are afraid that someone might hurt their feelings. It is your fcking feelings go to therapy ffs!",2024-09-29T14:33:11Z,0,0

It's a turn based top-down RPG. It's a VERY good turn-based top-down RPG, with more reactivity than a lot of previous entries to the genre could dream of, but they weren't recreating the wheel. They were just refining something they love.
Forget about the woke crap, that's all business now that's meaning has been lot through political wrangling. It's bad, but it's not the root of the creative problem. Anywhere where politics take precedence over quality and discourages HONEST discourse is gonna make crap. It doesn't matter what those politics are.
For a good creative direction though, I think just trying to EVOKE or SHOCK or take RISKS is also bad. Though maybe it's better than what we have. Taking a risk doesn't mean there's a safety net at the end of the cliff. Not all CRPGs are BG3. 
I think if you really want to creatively emulate BG3 then look at the context of it. The Divinity games feel like sketches with BG3 being the final masterpiece. There's an obvious enjoyment of CRPGs and D&D in the top parts of the company that bleeds into the game. Most games' purposes is first to be fun for players, and BG3 never forgets that. BG3 wasn't aiming for financial success (by how the game ran the company into the ground before release) nor to be a game for everyone. Yet, because it wanted to be a fun CRPG on all levels (visual, story, gameplay, roleplay) it GOT everybody to buy into what the developers loved about the CRPGs they played. A game like BG3 builds on the games that came before it. It isn't BG1, a trailblazer, but the current pinnacle of the genre. 
""Woke"" games remind me of christian media. They're too concerned with being right than with doing WHAT SHOULD COME BEFORE ALL ELSE. A lot of Christian media lacks either the depth of hard-hitting questions because they don't want to show faith, believers, or god in a bad light. Which does the exact opposite by making them look gormless and shallow. Of course, C.S. Lewis shows that christian media with depth, artistry, and real joy in writing can exist.
Which forces me to believe that this Woke media is less an issue of politics, and more a loss of creative vision. Politics can be a great motivation for a creative vision, but if their beliefs are so shallow only to be broken by the softest of critiques, then I think those individuals need to reexamine themselves until what they truly want to make comes out. Or, in the case of Ubisoft, just letting people speak freely would be a nice start.
Which hits a lot of bits of what you said later in the video before I started typing but I wanted to rant too, dammit.",2024-09-29T10:02:59Z,0,0

Even though they planned this game for years already, they stated he and naoe were going to be leads for the game ages ago, they literally told yall why they picked yasuke and why he fits perfectly for a lead for the gsme to add to the story but yall were made cause he was balck and not white. 

Also forgot to say, iroinc u are such un denial claiming that it is Japanese ppl and fans of the games that got upset when u know that isnt true and your own comment section is proof of it. U literally denied that it were racist westerners that were being upset for asians and Japanese ppl , literally crying about how it is disrespectful and how it isnt representing jaoan in your fetishized idea just cause it wasnt a white dude but yasuke being black, where u clowns complained about chinese architecture and language being used. When these things are literally accurate to Japan and the culture since china is a massive influence.
Then complaining about bloody floor mats not being the right shape when they can be in any shape. Yet not one of yall compalained about the inaccuracies in the older gsmes nor had the same issues.

I have loved the assassins creed games since I was a kid all the way back to Altair and Ezio. I‚Äôve missed a couple in between but I‚Äôve played a majority of them because I truly wanted to see where the story went.

I can‚Äôt put into words how little interest I have in Shadows. None. My first immediate thought goes to a Temu version of Ghost of Tsushima and it just immediately puts a bad taste in my mouth. IMO, they should have done one, maybe two more games to wrap up AC as a whole and give it a hell of an ending after Valhalla. Mirage sure as hell wasn‚Äôt it because it was not rememberable at all in my experience playing it. 

 But when it comes to money and making sure you‚Äôre sticking to modern day DEI in everything you do‚Ä¶execs will choose those all day long. Same thing with Outlaws with the absolute piss poor effort that game is. It‚Äôs sad tbh.

Asian Americans and European Asians are so ignored in both continents.  Seriously, a top rank officer in a popular gaming company told their PR team and employees to ignore the criticism of what the Asian community (Japanese people) is pointing out is so infuriating and saddening.   Reminds me of the COVID incidents where black people were randomly punching Asian Americans in the US especially in New York.  This incident was ignored and silenced multiple times by New York politicians but when the attacks turned from assault to multiple murders then they finally acknowledged the violence.  Being Asian in North America and Europe is so painfully tiring, ignored, and saddening.  
Another action UBISOFT should remove from Assassin Creed Shadows is when Yusuke was walking people would stop and bow.  The Japanese were just too busy correcting everything about the game but that bowing program will be noticed a lot more when it comes back.  Go watch Japanese historical dramas hardly you see commoners or peasants bow to samurais out in public unless the commoners or peasants are addressed directly by the samurais (even then the act of bowing is situational).",2024-09-29T02:00:39Z,0,1

Anyone can see that the inclusion of Yasuke is a blatant piss-poor attempt by Ubisoft to try and score brownie points among liberal-minded gamers and some kind of fictious social justice scorecard.  They were so blinded by this they used Chinese characters in place of Japanese texts, blatantly stole a flag from a Japanese Rifle Reenactment Company,  used a half torri gate for merchandise promotional material without understanding its cultural significance to the Japanese people.  They were so obsessed with promoting a black samurai and screaming they're not racists but they were being racists and racially insensitive to the Japanese people and culture.  What pisses me off  about these so-called SWJs is the fact they want to promote Africans as the only minority race out there in the world.

But we also need to remember that Ubisoft became a commercial behemoth long ago, more in the hands of it‚Äôs shareholders than of it‚Äôs historical creative leads that left long ago, the same fate that blizzard EA Activision and others have met.

And what does that mean ? Well these companies are trying most likely to market themselves into American territory, yes there is maybe less population than in Asia, but it‚Äôs a wealthier population more open to occidental games (studios and ideas).
And let‚Äôs face it, most Americans don‚Äôt know/care about all these (important sure but still) details about Japanese culture, the half arch, the time of the year where Sakura blossoms is not the same that the one where rice is planted, etc.

All of that is very important to the Japanese culture, but in the American market mind, it‚Äôs shrines, sakura, and samurais, not much more.

These companies are trying to market to their targets, not being necessarily creative or respectful.

And guess what, even with the rants online, Ubisoft games are still selling high, creatively dull sure, but selling high.",2024-09-28T19:52:54Z,0,0

That's fine, and maybe you're okay with that. Most things on the internet are so radicalized these days that one side cannot see the other.

Diversity and inclsivity in video games is totally achieveable without a team pushing for DEI and wokeness in the team maing the game.

Perhaps Ubisoft interpreted DEI wrong? Will this game fail as badly as Star Wars Outlaws or Concord, only time will tell. Personally this game is avoid atm, unless they rid themselves of the virtuous signalling and use a genuine Japanese person for samurai.

This is a fundamental societal issue. I think that the ""pre-woke era"" was very insensitive and intolerant to many social issue and as smaller societies joined the global community and became more aware of one another, people pushed back against it. I also think that what we see now with the ""woke era"" is an overcorrection in the attempt to remedy that by tipping the scale in the opposite direction towards fear and oversensitivity. Now there's a push-back to that too.  The balance between two extremes usually lies somewhere in the middle, and from a larger perspective, all of this looks to me like nature's attempt at finding that sweet spot. As for whether we'll actually reach that balance, I do not know. After all, societies are constructs and they are no longer architectured by human nature (the masses), but rather by a class of people who think themselves to be better.",2024-09-28T12:02:39Z,0,2

This is just a PR move to protect those who are living the fantasy that toxic dudebros are causing the game to fail. Ubisoft will make some press release about how the DEI side of the game was never an issue and it was just a bad release schedule, and the PR team will get hit with the redundancy bat.

I couldn't bring myself to complete AC4 since it was released until now, and I would like to say that it feels like a cartoon. Plot is completely unserious, making you feel no emotions at all. I'd say, both plot and gameplay are empty. Being a pirate, plundering, there is much death in that, but even when you board the ships in the game, it didn't look to me as something that would instill fear in those poor sailors.

You the consumer have the power to dictate the games that are made the way you dictate is with your wallet. I refuse to do preorder‚Äôs because so many games are broken. I wait to buy this so trusted gamers I watch play the game and I review it along with them. Sometimes opinions line up other times they don‚Äôt always. It means I have an honest impression and a honest review vs the ‚Äúprofessional critics‚Äù 

2nd Thor and amazing fellow, developer and streamer has tons of videos teaching and encouraging people how to make games. It‚Äôs not for everyone but don‚Äôt be afraid to. Games made by gamers are made with love and passion. 

3rd bonus fact gamers don‚Äôt care the race, the gender or the pronouns but when that is the only selling point and the mechanics, story and graphics look and act worse than a ps1 game with tank controls or worse. It‚Äôs garbage. They could replace the samurai character with  Miyamoto Musashi it wouldn‚Äôt matter if the gameplay was still horrible, the time period is still incorrect, they still use Chinese structures in place of authentic Japanese buildings and architecture, and still released the Torii gate statue showcasing the bombing of Nagasaki. I wouldn‚Äôt touch it with a 10 foot pole and would still harp on it like everyone else. Plenty of great minorities and gender neutral characters have existed. Just in much better games and stories where that is an interesting tidbit not the whole selling premise. Sargeant Johnson will forever remain one of my favorite characters in Halo and had some of the best dialogue. I think some gamers actually enjoy him as a character than Chief because chief was meant to be a neutral character you could implant yourself upon no matter who you were by not revealing his face and that was stated by bungie all those years ago.",2024-09-28T10:16:47Z,0,0

Mind you, that does not mean that we should not scold ubisoft for screwing up cultural representation in a game of this magnitude, it's just most of this feels like useless rage rather than objective critique.

The rest of the video felt good, if this DEI safe play stuff is what shapes the company's internals it's really bad and the outrage is fair.

They are not a reenactment group. They're larpers who thought it would be fun to dress up in period costumes but also shoot guns at the same time. There is no such thing as a Sekigahara gun corps in real life, they made it up. That's the entire point of why Japanese people think it's so ridiculous that Ubisoft stole their flag - Imagine if a game about the US civil war decided to include people dressed in Star Wars costumes. Ubisoft's devs kept droning on and on about how accurate and faithful to history the game is at first (they started pulling out the contradictory ""it's fiction, it's just a game, we never meant for it to be accurate"" bullshit later) and this was just one of many indications of how full of shit they were.

And it should be pointed out that Hashimoto does not understand Japanese and was ridiculed by everyone when they started to post Google translated gibberish in an attempt to ""prove"" that they could. Pathetic.",2024-09-28T07:03:53Z,0,0

How can you claim your game to be historically accurate when you use Yasuke, an actual historical figure, as a workaround for your female protagonist (which wasn't the first time they do this, look at Alexios/Kassandra and the two gendered Eivor)? How can you be so dense when responding to the criticisms of actual Japanese people?

The more I see these controversies, the more I'm convinced this game only exists to leech off of Ghost of Tsushima's success, but they didn't see the beautiful landscapes, the attention to detail on the culture, conflict and time period they represented or the fact that this game even pushed tourism for the real life island of Tsushima, all they saw was an opportunity to bank on samurais because that sells. No wonder they jumped ship out of Tokyo Game Show or else the public would've reacted with the scorn they deserve.

It seems that it lacks more research and understanding of Japanese history.

Having an African character in feudal Japan doesn't bother me. But making him a playable character  with warrior like mechanics? I don't know.

Woke is almost meaningless and the subject is more diverse. Checkbox Woke? Too long? FuxWoke? Iddno, something that means diversity and Inclusion for the sake of it.

If someone has to force it/shoehorn it in, it would never be such a way to solve problem. That's what they don't see. If UBISOFT(launch) has to hire someone to ""Correct"" their artists, that consultant is not going to resolve any societal issues. They might have good intentions, but this is the result. Majority rejection.

You make a product that does not appeal to an indisputable majority, you will not sell your product to any majority.
I think the problem with DEI ""professionals"" is that they are not artists. They are not hired to create. They are hired to destroy. They are the people who put things into boxes and if the real art does not fit into a box of which they alone have decided the requirements, they will crop existing art.

Both boys and girls like looking a pretty girls. I mean... How can UGLY be a choice for a medium wholly centered on escapism? The sure idiocy of what DEI are trying to enforce was always destined to blow up in their face because they are trying to force something. They are crafting new ""conservatives"". They themselves are crafting the ""anti-FuxWoke"" push back. Censorship will always lead to this in free countries like America.

if ur a grocery store and u order X amount of an item but don‚Äôt sell it by a determined time period, it‚Äôs considered a financial loss for that period, even if u can and do sell it in the next period.

So by similar logic all the money spent producing and especially promoting AC Shadows throughout FY2023-24 will be a huge loss for the year‚Äôs bottom line. It‚Äôs common practice across many industries to line up movies, albums, new product lines, and so on right before a fiscal deadline to help with accounting and boost numbers last minute

Ubisoft WILL release a bad or unfinished game instead of delaying it until proper execution.

But the silver lining is that for a few years now all the talent that bled out of Ubisoft is now in used in incredible indie studios that released really good and creative games, they're niche, less ambitious of course so we don't always hear much about them.

This Yasuke could have been a side/quest character because he clearly is a historical character.

But you can't act like a black samurai being in the game is misrepresenting japanese culture when the black samurai is based on a real historical figure that lived in japan. Although it is not 100% clear weither or not he was a samurai, there have been many other books about Yasuke where he is portrayed as a samurai, including japanese books. He was even a character in nioh 2 as a black samurai and nobody cared, so I'm a bit surprised by this.

I have a lot of problems with Ubisoft, I don't even remember the last time I bought one of their game. But they clearly spend a lot of care making sure their games are historically accurate and true to the setting.

Firstly, Yasuke despite being basically the only black samurai actually was an important figure at the time, because he was a in the retinue of Oda Nobunaga, who is literally the most important figure of the time. He was also witness to his assassination, and its not totally clear what happened to him after. So independent of the novelty of Yasuke being a black samurai, he's a pretty good choice as a main character because of his proximity to these events. He was also a real person, so the criticism of his inclusion as being ""woke"" is nonsense, that's just people expecting black characters to be excluded so the game doesn't appear ""woke.""

Secondly, it terms of creative liberties taken with the portrayal of Japan at the time, this is pretty standard for an Assassin's Creed game. 

None of this would be an issue if the game was good. The problem is we don't expect it to be good because AC games have gooten formulaic, soulless, uninteresting, full of heavily padded quests that ars all the same, lacking in mystery, creativity or challenege. Obviously Ubisoft is going to deflect these criticisms and say its an anti-woke backlash (and some of it is), but it doesn't matter if the game is actually bad.",2024-09-27T19:58:27Z,0,0

Nioh's main character was a white samurai and was based on an actual person, narrative liberties notwithstanding. Everybody liked William. 
Even the game Expeditions Rome features a Maori playable character because such people historically did exist in ancient Rome, and another one of your companions is a woman who actually will be subjected to proper gender bias of the time and be denied several privileges that men enjoyed. Hell, you can play as a woman yourself who despite some narrative liberties will also be subjected to the same bias, such as being denied the right to hold office and required to enter a political marriage. The game as a whole got many of the period details right, even down to how genders are being addressed, i. e. dominus for men and domina for women. 
The point? 
There's a difference between being anachronistic but still respectful and being out-and-out revisionist and insulting. Ubisoft clearly likes to be the latter.",2024-09-27T18:48:22Z,0,0

So many are afraid of cancel culture clowns they brush blatant and dishonest bullshit under the rug instead of highlighting it like you have. It all started with pushing identity politics to box everyone into a group, no matter how absurd or detached from reality that group is. If your group is infringed upon, accurately or just for the sake of humor, you can cry discrimination and it's a PR/legal nightmare. So corporations leaned heavily into protecting themselves by ACTING like they're protecting these groups. They enable and blindly support them so they could never be accused by these desperately frail groups of discrimination. That's why everything is neutered now.

Some time later, other people were offended and felt sorry for the donkey and told him to be ashamed and let the donkey rest. So both him and his wife decided to walk with the donkey.

Some time later, the people felt offended that Joha and his wife were walking with the donkey and not taking advantage of it so they can rest.

I honestly am not sure what else it could be. I feel like devs need to go into a box and make a game while completely disconnected from the world and then come out with said game not influenced by all the dumb shit they can't seem to get over like twitter drones talking shit.

Most of the time I take the claims from big media with a grain of salt, but this time, I think they're being honest, as I am not seeing that much outrage from the Japanese themselves. In the west right now, the left is a dying movement, and more and more are allinging themselves with the anti-woke brigade. This angry reaction from people based in the west is understandable, as the woke movement is a thing of the past, and people are not willing to put up with it any longer.

This creator said that marketing of black myth wukong was the worst example of dishonesty in journalism they noticed and I couldn't help but think this is all well known to people who aren't very left leaning politically.  They are contradicting themselves by banning the person who said saying ""retarded"" isn't appropriate in 2024.  So on one hand people have to be able to handle frustration and being offended and yet their response when confronted with it is to ban the person? How did no one point this hypocrisy out to the creator?

Pagoda‚Äôs have existed since early Asuka period (538-710) due to the rampant buddhism and in major part due to one of the officials Prince Shotoku interest in the culture. 

I ran into many twitter accounts reposting a picture of a 3 tiered Pagoda which to my knowledge is historically accurate as can be, since a famous 3 tier pagoda- the Kojoji Temple made during the Muromachi period (1333-1573) was made around the time when Yusuke was known to be alive 1555-1582~

I think people should get off their high horse when it comes to these things because clearly- no one actually does their research to find that these rumours stirred because of Tatami Mats found in the preview trailer being square and not rectangular, with the image of that journalist website being the image of the pagoda with the title ‚Äúhistorically inaccurate‚Äù

The half torii gate was insanely crude though and in poor taste, but honestly I couldn‚Äôt imagine them having done that on purpose. They probably legit thought it looked cool at the time and used less resources to sculpt. Outside of that, they better just change it or discontinue it‚Ä¶ that is‚Ä¶ _woof._

I hate how corporate has turned appreciation of a culture fully realized in a 3d world into a shit show like this, I genuinely don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs fault outside of the higher ups in ubisoft.

Focus on the internal comapny. Focus on the Service for your live-games. Focus on educating your employees. Get them experience with more games, more engines, more tech. Upgrade your hardware for your top tier developers and focus on the things, that where told by the community the last 3 years. Make a team to point out, what is important to the gamers. And dont try to ""ignore"" or ""ban"" the things, instead try to put them into your team and remove the obsticales. If something is too much.

And than make a comeback... no assassins creed. nothing that is ""new"" to your team, no cooperation-stuff like Star Wars. ... bring us something we know the studio for. Bring us something your developers are giving their lifeblood for. Give us something spectacular. Something like a comeback of Splinter Cell... mabye Rainbow Six: Patriots. Maybe For Honor 2... And foucs on that game only when it comes out. Major priority for the next 3-6 months. Give us content... no p2w-crap or NFT sh*t. CONTENT. Listen to your players feedback and maybe then you can go in other directions.",2024-09-27T16:24:28Z,0,0

I think progressive ideas are very important and and to be open and to even force people to experience cultures or individuals they normally wouldn't the only way to get out of your own prejudices is through interaction with things other than you're seeing. And yes there is a lot of discourse from outlaws that are just a bunch of neckbeards in their basement being upset that she's not f*ckable enough. But there are real criticisms that need to be seen and as a balance there between being open to new ideas and not allowing people's prejudices preventing you from telling a story at the same time it feels like they're artificially doing it the assassin's Creed statue that is getting s*** and deserves the s*** it's getting is a prime example of that. They're not genuinely trying to be diverse or progressive they are doing it because it's what should be expected and so they're overcompensating and it's coming off disingenuous. It's complicated you definitely don't want to give those far-right douchebags a mouthpiece but You can't put yourself into a offended little bubble emojis don't matter racism does not respecting a culture's landmark does. They need to find this balance and respect it,2024-09-27T16:09:22Z,0,1

Console and PC gaming is a primarily male dominated market, and a niche market at that.
Mobile gaming is where the majority of female gamers play, and where the majority of money in the games industry comes from.
Therefore I believe console gaming should pander to the stereotypical male, think of it like playboy, who buys them? Men, but I'm sure many women work in the publishing, editing and many other sectors at playboy, but what you don't see in playboy are disgusting overweight whales with gross skin conditions, why? Because it's aimed at a primarily male audience!
When women come into the console games industry, it is so important to understand who their audience actually is, and that their audience doesn't get offended.
This isn't just aimed at female Devs, but also those whiny little soft cocks too.

The tirade about being mad that somebody was made uncomfortable by you calling something retarded (y'know, a derogatory ableist term) was weird. I get it, slip-ups happen, but the correct reaction there is ""yeah, product of my upbringing, my mistake, sorry about that,"" not, ""I'm banning you for being slightly uncomfortable."" That tirade was just... fucking weird, dawg. That said, there were some good and reasonable takes - misogyny is bad, obviously, but overcorrection to the point of discouraging physically attractive body archetypes etc is wild.

Prince of Persia, Far Cry 2 and 3, Rayman, first couple of Assasin's Creed, Splinter Cell.
Then they fucked everything up with their greed and some baffling decisions.
""Oh yeah, let's fucking release 12 assassins creed games in the span of 5 years with 0 improvements to gameplay, that'll sell great! And lets even make them into a shitty GaaS, because why not.
This Far Cry thing, the gritty sandbox shooter about horrors of losing humanity? Lets turn it into a funny farce! Look, here's a funny dog! Haha!
Prince of Persia? Rayman? What the fuck are you talking about?""

And now this. I was dreaming about japanese Assassin's Creed as a kid, playing as a ninja and not as a fucking samurai, whose whole philosophy is face your enemy, killing people from behind is a big nono, punished by disgraceful death. They already have the framework, just make japanese decorations and use ninja clan as a big plot point - and they're golden. But NO, they had to make this shit. I don't care in the slightest that mc is a black guy or some shit like that, it's just so fucking obvious what they should do to make a good game and they purposefully did not do it.

What this confirmation of their refusal to listen proves is that Ubisoft thinks they're foolproof, and that their games will generate a substantial profit no matter what.  They think their young gamers and casual gamers customer bases, and the way they charge nearly double-price for their games and sell them for about 100% actual value when they're ""on sale"" will be enough to outweigh the disapproval and sales losses of more seasoned and discerning gamers, and for a long time that has been precisely the case.  

However...

With this issue becoming bigger and bigger, and with Ubisoft mismanaging the development of every game they make at this point, I think the worm has turned, or, at least, it's very close to it.  Thank god.  

It makes me so sad to know the Ubisoft I used to love is dead, but it is.  The developer who made some of the best games ever, is just gone‚Äîa shell of their former selves, hollowed out by greed.  Killed by an addiction to income at any cost.  But that's important to recognize.  This isn't the Ubisoft we love and remember‚Äîthis is the replacement, the anti-Ubisoft, and we need to let it die.  

Do not give Ubisoft money, no matter what tricks they pull.  
Just don't do it.

Try it yourself.  ""We.""  ""tod.""  ""ded.""  Those three syllables not only require minimal mouth movement, but when vocalized around strangers by a small child, ALSO TRIGGER HELP.  ""Police"" and ""Please"" are similar enough that those two words are the most important vocabulary words for a mute or disabled child to be able to get out in case of emergency.  Raise your hand and repeat ""wetoded plees""  until someone helps, or contacts the police.   40+ years of training, education, speaking drills - I live the fantasy of so many people with learning disabilities - being largely indistinguishable from anyone else without close scrutiny.

I know... Ubisoft is starting to get soft, and clearly working with the woke agenda in mind, every year fucking up their releases, and when it comes to ACS, the only word that comes to mind is ""silly"", at most... but I'll still play the game. The fact that a black guy is one of the main protagonists for me is just silly (based on cultural accuracy, and not from a racist standpoint), but then I remember... Games are fantasy... WHO GIVES A FUCK?
Play the games for what they are... Games... Fantasy... and bitch more about the lack of mechanics, bugs, etc, and bitch less about what biological gender or skin color character you're playing as.
When Lara Croft games came out, I didn't see any bitching about that.
I'm not defending Ubisoft in any way, I worked for them for 5 years, like... 10 years ago, and yes, things have changed, but it just seems like if people would stop giving a shit about certain issues, the gaming community would be less filled with hatred. Silly times we live in üòÇ

Suddenly the artists and pitch behind making your character, and the manager or higher-ups that move it forward, all don't want to be ""that guy"" that picks a highly attractive looking female. I can remember in the DarkSouls design works there was a passage discussing how Gwynevere 'broke' from the design norms in certain way, but the artist was just ""a little too proud"" to argue with (or something like that), and they made it work. She was an illusion and token of hope and respite anyway, so they didn't have to make her a great demon creature or knight anyway. Still, that artist did the exact opposite, and the companies don't expect that anymore over here. It makes more sense that the history of the industry makes them more scared at an individual level to present this stuff, rather than just chalking it up to ""DEI said to make them ugly"". I mean they're definitely still feeling that pressure if companies like SBI are breathing over their heads, but its more likely rooted that no male artist is gonna make an idealist image, or even a female artist making a power fantasy will then take it to some male middle-manager that doesn't want to feel weird about elevating that, etc. That really sucks, but its cool insight I wasn't considering before.",2024-09-27T13:37:29Z,0,1

Do people really think that when people say something about someone or a mass group of people are retarded, somebody actually thinks a particular person using said word are targeting actual medical retarded people? No! Absolutely not! It's not even a medical term anymore. Nobody who says the word retarded thinks about people who have a severe mental issue. We've been saying that word for decades. This cancel culture nonsense needs to stop.

From Wikipedia:

*Pejorative: (A pejorative word, phrase, slur, or derogatory term is a word or grammatical form expressing a negative or disrespectful connotation, a low opinion, or a lack of respect toward someone or something.

For Example:
- Much like today's socially acceptable terms idiot and moron, which are also defined as some sort of mental disability, when the term retard is being used in its pejorative form, it is usually not being directed at people with mental disabilities. Instead, people use the term when teasing their friends or as a general insult.

Rosa's Law: (In the medical world, medical retardation has been replaced)
- Despite not typically being used in official context, ""mental retardation"" was still written in many of the United States' laws and documents until October 5, 2010, when U.S. President Barack Obama signed into effect S. 2781, also known as Rosa's Law.[12] The bill changed references in federal law; the term mental retardation was replaced by mental disability. Additionally, the phrase ""mentally retarded individual"" was replaced with ""an individual with an intellectual disability"".[13] Rosa's Law was named after Rosa Marcellino, a nine-year-old girl with Down syndrome. She worked with her parents to have the words ""mentally retarded"" officially removed from health and education code in Maryland, her home state.[14] With this new law, ""mental retardation"" and ""mentally retarded"" no longer exist in federal health or education and labor policy. The rights of individuals with disabilities would remain the same.[12] The goal of this change in phrasing was to remove language that may be considered derogatory to communities. 

If I say something is retarded, my mind doesn't go... ""There are people with a medical and mental disability, so now I'm going to say this word retarded to someone"". ""Hey, you guys are retarded!"". ""YES! I got em!"". Are these guys going to go home thinking that someone calling them retarded, now think that they may have an undiagnosed mental disorder, who should all go to the doctor for a checkup? NO!

Legendary Drops, nor does anyone else on planet earth, uses the word retarded while also thinking about about someone with a disability.
It does not happen. It is a slur.

Another slur word many people say is, ""Blind"". Cohh Carnage brought up this topic a few years ago, after people got offended in chat, after he used the word blind. Cohh said that this is ridiculous, who will continue to use blind. Cohh, nor does anyone else saying ""Are you blind?"" are actually thinking about an actual blind person, who is offending someone. And, I back Cohh up on that claim. ""How did you miss that shot? Are you blind?"" It's used all the time.

This cancel culture crap has got to stop. People get so upset over the most ""insane"" things today. Everyone gets so easily offended, and I'm sick of it.

Yes, I said ""insane."" Can you believe that? How could I possibly say such an awful word? Wow!
- Don't you dare tell me you are offended by using the word ""Insane"".
- Do you think when I say someone is insane, now means that I am at this moment thinking about someone locked in a cell, with a straitjacket on, who is jumping and slamming into padded walls, for hours on end? NO friggen way! Sure, I just technically did think about someone who is insane (schizophrenia, and other psychotic disorders right now, but my version of insane can be perceived in many different ways, depending on the individual. You're mental process about the word ""insane"", visually to you, may be absolutely perceived so differently to how I visualize the word ""insane"".

Lighten up people! It's why jokes suck today, because comedians are afraid to say what they want to say, that is 100% due to this cancel culture world we now live in, and I absolutely hate it! Nobody is happy anymore with anything said today, and it sucks. Am I allowed to laugh at anything anymore? Can I not have fun and laugh with words somebody says, or words that I say? What on earth is going on with people today? Let someone say something, and move on. Don't try to correct someone. No one likes a person who constantly corrects someone. It is annoying. If you are one of these people who is constantly correcting someone, and are wondering why you have no friends, well it's because of your behavior.

I've said enough here. I can't believe I just went on-and-on ranting over the words retarded, blind, and insane.
Oh nooo guys... Maybe I'm insane? Dun dun dunnnnn! Maybe I need to go see a doctor to get a checkup.ü§£

Great video as always, Legendary Drops!

Where were these complaints with the Dr Who levels of accuracy we saw in Origins, Odyssey and Valhalla? Ever since AC1 it has been filled to the brim with anachronisms and a cultural pick-and-mix attitude to gear and clothing, equivalent to someone today wearing crocs and lederhosen. Historical people are aged up, down, their location, status, looks and mannerisms rewritten to fit the narrative. AC2 had us fly a Da Vinci glider and drive a tank in renaissance Rome! In Origins we fought a Minotaur! 

The historical accuracy in AC: Shadows is the same as it has ever been. 
Some of the sudden demands for perfect accuracy can be explained away with pure Gell-Mann amnesia.

You have autorickshaws with a steering wheel which drives up mountainous rocky regions which is not possible, the driver speaking in Tamil, inscription all around the place written in hindi having no actual meaning (gibberish madeup words), no actual research done a complete bad mixup of Indian and Nepali culture, some parts were done right but 80% of it was just a disproportionate cultural representation.

Hate it every time when a big youtuber/creator goes ""look at this industry! Look! Also let me bitch about misusing the word and someone noticing, let me just sneak that into my whole righteous speech"".
Words change meaning and have different weight over time. Queer was offensive before queer community made it their own. Retard was a funny insult until the world became more aware of the illness.
You were using it before and it became a force of habit, everyone gets it and it's not a big deal. Same as no one would care if you accidentally called a trans person by the wrong pronounce not knowing who they are. No sane person will hound you for that, not talking about twitter folk out here. 
My apologies, but as a 100k+ YouTuber it just comes out wrong when you start bitching about people being on standby to be offended by you specifically. You said retard in chat and one viewer out of your whole stream became concerned? And your response was to ban them, because the question offended you so much? 
Preach what you preach. I agree completely with the overall message, managerial decisions to kill project after project with marketable ""diversity"" is depressing. But don't glue yourself to the issue just because you used to say retard when it was funny, and now you are hurt when someone doesn't understand this as a joke like you did in your time.
I'm focusing on the ""hard R"" statement so much, because it's what a lot of youtubers seem to be transfixed on. If you treat your viewers like all they want to do is beef with you on these topics, the overall atmosphere will be that. For all I know that one viewer you banned just wanted to educate you on the modern meaning of the word.",2024-09-27T12:30:29Z,0,0

Oh, wait... They don't care about consumer feedback, they only care about maximizing profits before they die on a hill many companies are finding out that, if you keep selling sh*t, eventually the consumer will stand up to these wasters. Remember, EA did a sales conference in which they spent 90% of it talking about maximising revenue through live service, 9% of it stuttering, and 1% about the actual games they offer. 

We're in a time where we're finding out digitalisation of games is a massive, massive mistake. They can take your games away just like that, they force microtransactions that are extremely predatory and actually impact gameplay progression.

Forced diversity is bad, it undermines the whole point of diversity.

To many people get hungup on ""diversity itself bad"" when that isnt actually a problem whatsoever. Its that its forced. Concord was bad not because of diversity but because it was just shit. Outlaws was shit not because of diversity (Star wars always been diverse) but because it was just bland ubisoft sloop.
Shadows is bad not because of diversity but because it is missing Diversity, specifically Japanese diversity and accuracy.
Freaking weirdos on both sides of the gaming community currently and it just makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. Look at Baldurs Gate, probably the MOST diverse game we seen in decades, if not ever, and it was a massive success cause people could be whatever they wanted and it was amazing.

What sickens me most is that it is often the overcorrection that gets things to be sour; Ubisoft with all its massive rape and harashments, Blizzard with its greed theft and murder, and we dont even need to mention EA cause holy shit.

Bottom line: Diversity isnt the problem. Greedy companies trying to shift the blame is.",2024-09-27T11:27:31Z,0,0

I feel as if you take a step back and just look at it from a simple gamers perspective. Take all the DEI, and hurt feelings out of it. I think having a game like AC-Shadows telling a story about a (most likely) fictional character in early japan, is a good thing for freshing up the gaming genre space. As long as they can actually get the culture correct (hense the half Torii gate meaning) i dont think theres a priblem with telljng a story about a fictional character, inside a fictional story based driven game. ITS ALL FOR FUN, and i think thats alot of what people forget. 

How many culturally innacurately depicted games did we play when all this ""words hurt"" shit didnt matter when we were either kids... or teenagers playong LAN parties on Halo 2.   ALOT

Because we all knew it is fictional characters inside a game that is made to play and have fun. 

I understand why the Japanese people are mad about the inaccuracies of the game culturally, but as the game in a whole, i think people need to take a step back and realize once again that its just a game... and that video games arent real. They are ways to tell fictional stories, with fictional characters, that you, the player, has the ability to control. 

Just like the feeling of when I (AND MANY OTHERS) read lord of the rIngs, and then played your first good lord of the rings game on PS2/xbox.  You could control your favorite FICTIONAL character inside your favorite universe. 

So, as far as assassin's creed shadows goes, i think that Yasuke is an awesome fictional character to play as, seeing how other than Afro Samurai is the closest thing we have gotten to play Yasuke. As long as the damn company that makes it doesn't shit on the culture the certain character is coming from, if they are going to attempt as much historical accuracy as possible (with adding a character like yasuke in) they need to do it with respect.",2024-09-27T09:51:55Z,0,0

A younger me Applied for a goodwill that was opening near my home, and after being accepted I was put in donation receiving. My job was basically to assist people in bringing in items they wished to donate and writing them a tax slip if they wanted it. The problems started when the people that process the donation in the back of the store stopped doing their jobs and just played on their phones. I had to keep up with my job, and leave my post to do their job so I could keep doing mine. I was getting reprimanded for not staying at my part of the job until the manager told me I should go home and cool off, I told her to shove it and that I quit. 
Flash forward a few days later and I get a call from the nicer manager at the store and get offered my job back. I declined. Flash forward 6 years later and I am applying for a goodwill in a completely different state and the topic of my prior employment comes up. I explain where I worked and what I did, turns out my goodwill became famous for having it's entire staff fired and replaced a month after opening day, a week after I quit.

That felt.. bitter sweet. Some of the people there didn't deserve it, but unfortunately scorched earth is far better than letting it feaster in these situations",2024-09-27T09:45:42Z,0,0

You're just trying to pin the company's issues on the bogeymen you've been crying about. I dont doubt that others have been crying about them too, it makes the news, but it's hardly why the Star Wars game did poorly. It did poorly as the gameplay was shit. You're saying the developers are saying the problem is the management not listening to criticism? The developrs are the ones who pulled banners wholesale from real life groups without permission. The developers did a lot of the stuff you're talking about, not the management.

The problem is that the people calling the shots don't focus on the game being fun. It'd be possible to make a wildly historically innacurate game if they just focused on the game design. Instead they pad it out and water down the gameplay, focusing on using as much of the player's time as possible instead of tigh and rewarding game loops. Every game must be bigger than the last one, 100 hours but without enough gameplay for more than 10 or 20. All money spent on art assets, not enough spent on game design / combat / balancing.

The toxic work environment behind the scenes that blew up into sexual harassment allegations played a part, but still only part of the problem. Ubisoft used to dump on PC players, openly admitting they cared less about them and thus ports were buggier. They rushed games, made decisions to move games into annual releases, emphasized quantity over quality. 

Comparing a Ubisoft game to Baldur's Gate 3 is an insult to Larian. Larian spent so many years working on one game they genuinely cared for, worked with the community in early access for years, listened, and it shows. Ubisoft just tries to push out as many games as they can as fast as they can in a vacuum. The fact that they want to blame all this on their workplace culture changing is hysterical. I don't take their reasons seriously, it sounds like more old men whining about consequences of being justifiably cancelled for their actions. 

The cracks were showing before that happened. Assassin's Creed Unity came out before that happened, and it was the buggiest thing they made. Far Cry has seen reused assets like Primal's map being borrowed from 4, and New Dawn borrowed from 5. They made the decision to start pushing for always-online games, said that gamers should get used to the idea of their games just disappearing from libraries, embraced horrible DRM, and treat every IP like it's a slave. 

They intentionally nuked Skull and Bones early on. Their downfall is on them, well-deserved, and I won't miss them because I want to play games made by people who actually care, not some corporation that just wants to make more money for their shareholders by turning art into a conveyor belt of mediocrity. Let this company die like it should have earlier.",2024-09-27T08:46:53Z,0,0

""Beginning February 1, 2021, Sikka will join Ubisoft and report directly to Ubisoft co-founder and CEO, Yves Guillemot. While the role is intended to be flexible, a major focus for the new VP will be to establish and implement a comprehensive diversity and inclusion roadmap to support Ubisoft‚Äôs company culture at every level.""

In a introduction interview (also on their website) she stated that she will have entire strategy as a DEI VP and will also be looking how it can be implemented in the production cycle.

""Another area I‚Äôm looking forward to exploring is production. I understand the pressures and deadlines of preparing a product and shipping it, both from an entertainment and tech perspective. I‚Äôm curious to explore what it truly means to make inclusive games at Ubisoft, and how we can push forward in that space creatively and inclusively.""

She reports directly to Yves so him saying that there is no agenda being pushed... that's just the kind of lie, that should guarantee you a way out of business. 

Having a DEI VP in your company means that in fact you have a predator that has more power than the CEO. Stocks seem to confirm that and now you also know from the developers that they basically have their hands tied due to the fear of loosing their jobs. These people are basically too scared to be creative like they were with the Far Cry series. The same situation, the same fear is present at many other corporations, banks are unquestionable leader in all this.

As for the AC Shadows delay, I bet the production issues are not the main driver here. Adding more features always means adding new bugs. It is an endless development loop. You don't need to believe me, just ask any developer.
 
The company is basically showing us a middle finger while saying to take few months for cooling off as they will not change anything on their side.",2024-09-27T08:44:27Z,0,0

I mean, people will be too busy with Kingdom Come Deliverance and Monster Hunter to talk about AC: Shadows and the timing seems like so deliberate... with the Ghost of Yotei announcement - game is set in the same time period of Sengoku Jidai, they have a badass female character and it's Sucker Punch, they will show love and respect to the people and culture of Japan, after all, who in modern times even heard of Kurosawa and they had a whole homage to his movies in Ghost of Tsushima! Meanwhile Ubisoft can't even depict something as simple as a season with plants from three different seasons in one picture... When Sucker Punch bends history it's for good reason, they're adapting the time period and trying to make it feel like the samurai and shinobi stories we are accustomed to but when Ubisoft does it, there's no good reason behind any of it. Even choosing Yasuke as a protagonist is headscratching given that they had no problem inventing characters for previous games and now all of a sudden they take a historical figure and make it into a protagonist? And for what reason exactly? Ezio wasn't real, Cassandra and Alexios weren't real, Edward wasn't real - all they had to do there is interact with actual historical figures for legitimacy and now that's not enough!

However, I'd argue that if you're a cultural / DEI consultant who fails to point out how inappropriate that is, along with the Chinese architecture, etc. then they simply aren't doing their job. And that's the best case, the nicest thing we can argue for them!

DEI done well is a good thing. Avoiding offensive and lazy stereotypes, thinking about the wider audience, etc. is a good thing. Besides Tom Cruise, I had no idea that there even were any non-Japanese samurai. But there were, apparently. Therefore, having a black samurai as an NPC, even as a major character, would be both historically and culturally accurate as well as interesting. But to make them the main character is simply a bizarre choice, one that is likely to alienate a large market of Japanese gamers and beyond.

But these people aren't concerned with ""interesting"" (or fun for that matter), they just have a misdirected agenda that they're trying to impose on everyone else.",2024-09-27T08:17:36Z,0,0

But what amazed me was to see people that were afraind to speak freely as if we are in communism being afraid to tell a joke about the system because you might go to labor camp, or dissapear, and we`ve had that here in my country. And it is really shocking to see how comformative people can be, and its safe to say that is the no:1 formula to root out all the talanted people and people who have potential, because the conformative people get top positions for being ""nice"" and greasy, and tend to passively hate on the ""naughty"" talented people because that is a defense mechanism of the weak in order to secure one`s comfy position and countinue shoping expensive beers from E-bag (them lazy asses), and pay off their mortgages. And that being put in perspective you have a studio incapable of creating art anymore, and art is meant to be free in the broad sense of being real, dirty, offensive, dramatic, gritty, and whatever else that encircles the words free and authentic and is part of the real world. For anyone working there and finding sense or recognising what im saying, stay for maximum of 3 years, build a portfolio, and leave, there is a big wide world out there of investors and companies that actually want to make something good, with the ever expanding tools like unreal, unity etc. more independant studios are popping up, you will have more money and feel better about yourself. The biggest relief is not being forced to bend over to the souless ones. And fu+k me, toxic positivity is living fu+king Hell, its much much worse than standart toxicity.

Your audience that is going to be the main source of your income is the most valid source of information you need in order to make a good game. I always thought that to be as obvious as it could get.

They are not political, they don‚Äôt give a shat about ideology, they only took that ¬´¬†woke¬†¬ª route those past few years because they have been mislead into thinking that is what players wanted

Obviously no one wanted this, and as it starts reflecting on sales, in a bigger and bigger way game after game, game companies are also realizing they were wrong 

Now that being said, the situation is indeed dire for Ubisoft, and yet I am pretty sure all it will take is one good game

If the next AC or the next Far Cry or the next whatever (Splinter Cell..?) is a success, and if they manage to adress and fix some of the recurrent criticism they faced, then it will be alright

Because we as players are not white knights either

No matter what Ubisoft did, no matter what Ubisoft thinks, if they start making good games again, people will buy

Ghost of Tsushima is such a beloved game, with a similar setting and similar mechanics as modern AC games - to have its sequal announced so close to a game shrouded in controversy's release is begging for even more criticism.

About 1 year or such ago, I was playing and trying to sell a prime warframe set to a player, for an appropriate amount of platinums which is the premium value in the game but can be also exchanged between players, that guy said that price wasn't the real one for that set, that the set I was selling was worth less and such, I told him that price was fair and taken from the official market of the game on internet, he kept saying I was a scammer and started insulting me and I replied with basic insults such as ""Stupid"" and ""Idiot"". Then he asks for help to his gf or whoever she was (basically hiding behind a girl) and they both started insulting me with even racial slurs so I insulted them too with heavy insults and probably one of them reported me (I didn't report since I'm not the crybaby that they are) anyway I got permabanned, just like that, for one single mistake (did in self defense) in 8 years of playing that game, which just became more and more woke the more the time passed. I reached out to their support which only called me a bigot and said that they have zero tolerance for anything (apparently insulting someone 2vs1 is ok tho) and then they proceeded to block me on their support too. I just cursed them and still curse them to this day, I hope they fail so badly and hard that they will regret any choice they had in life, if I hated inclusivity at that time, after what they did I hate it even more now, fuck you Digital Extremes, and fuck you Ubisoft too.",2024-09-27T05:38:05Z,0,0

UBI-Crap corporate is completely retarded.  Yup, i said it.   Thanks soooooo much for your content on this!   This shit is soooo twisted.   Over correcting to catotonia, and penny pinching turn over rates.   Makes perfect sense now.  No wonder why some in the gaming community feel to likewise complian in the extremes, just to get some one listen, i suppose. ¬†

This whole mess is completely ridiculous... Like watching a train wreck in slow motion, wanting to help and warn the conducter of the passengers inpending doom, and buddy just smiles and nods then presses the gas.  Like wtf does one do in this case???   I guess just continue to vote with your wallet and watch the train smash, taking out all its dev employee passengers in the carnage, i guess.   Putting it bluntly: I guess shits really fucked, yo.      Daaaaam.    ¬†

Think though through this insight, there will be a silver lining down the road.   UBI-Crap just DIES, Jaded devs with good track record in thier specialty will come together, STAY independent and Private and develop new games that are not only fun, but hysterically controversial and capitalize on it.    I cant wait.  ¬†

Sadly however, i suppose the rage content, sheer vitriol, and mean spirited mockery of this tone deaf company will be all we will have left as catharsis as we witness their death spiral.      I really want to believe this Blind Optimism has a self refection aspect with in it that could find the right balance with creativity. That by its own meaning encourages contrasts as well inclusion. That does NOT punish things at odds, but instead looks for common ground.  After-all, it fucking should!    ¬†

This breaks me... Its clear why some are so pissed and conflicted...  But if UBI-Crap refuses to listen, refuses to care about ANYTHING other then revenue and shareholder stats...

Im 47 btw. In the last 15 yrs, well before Me too was a thing, Corporate suits took over the industry and the companies involved. These suits are as singularly driven as any Wall St. Shark. Whats worse, is they very much despise the people that buy the games they provide. We are wallets to be bled dry of every nickle, then discarded.  The effort to turn ""Players into Payers"" is so obvious in almost every facet of gaming now, I wish more people were disgusted with it as I am.

I find it Comedy gold that they point to critic scores, in an effort to celebrate themselves.  ""Popular gaming sites"" like IGN, PC Gamer and others, hate the average man that buys these products, as much as the suits, but these companies are all collage activist driven, with their ""They/Them's"" Misogyny! White straight male Evil! beliefs. And they are all Fluff girls for the gaming companies. If you dont know what a fluffer is, look it up.  All this has been going on for a good long time, but average ignorance and good will to fall for the same tricks, keeps these suits in business.

Like people saying politicians were up in arms, when really it was 1 very rightwing guy who's party is not taken seriously by other parties in Japan. And is asking for inquiries into this matter were thrown out. Also the petition that was going around could hardly be considered a massive amount of upset. Add onto that, that nearly every video on YouTube claiming people in Japan were upset over this, was from channels with an agenda, which is ironic considering these are often the same channels that criticize SBI for having an agenda.

All this has been fairly easy to dig up so maybe look a little deeper than your biases might initially permit you.

Edit: Also just because there is mass criticism and ratioing of videos, which i agree there is. Doesn't mean it's coming from those (the Japanese) who this actually impacts. Your statement doesnt prove anything. If anything it would make me want to dig deeper and maybe question what about my content attracts a certain demographic of person. You have had some very questionable takes and a quick view of your comments sections shows you do have quite a few of what many would consider toxic gamers. At best your channel also attracks a lot of people who are just against any inclusion and hide behind the, ""if its good inclusion its fine"". All this rage is from a trailer for a game. Just like the person who created the Steam list of games that SBI was involved in. No one talked about the fact that when he was interviewed, he admited to not playing most of the games on the list.

This shit has sucked the life out of everything, comedy, video games, movies you name it.  They push ideology and narratives. In fact if you look back at ubi devs talking about origins, odyssey, and valhalla, each one they said they didn't want to have a male protagonist, and they wanted diversity. But corporate knew their audience and made sure the option was there, each was a success and more successful than the one before it. Now we have protagonists that the majority of Buyers don't want to play as in shadows forced into the game, with no option that players want. And what does ubi say, too bad don't play it etc. What ubi and others don't understand is that this business model doesn't work. They have forgotten that they are competing with other companies and games for our money and time.

My biggest question. Why would a gaming company care about being woke? Obama was the Czar of the woke movement - which started about 2008? With the top heavy description of Ubisoft's management structure. It would be extremely interesting if NGO's are involved with Ubisoft and if they are receiving any financial gains for marketing woke content. Disney is huge for being in the woke movement - who owns Star Wars franchise. So Ubisoft being wrapped up in this woke mentality isn't surprising, I guess.",2024-09-27T04:23:32Z,0,0

But the peak of graphics quality was probably in 2016. After that, it was stable and declining. The overall decline in the quality of 3A games actually started in 2018. Repeating the same content over and over again. Like Call of Duty. But Ubisoft and EA are actually the same. Their games have begun to lack the development and maintenance of the basic code layer. This even affects the operation of the program. This shows that they lack not only senior engineers, but also programmers to help them solve code problems. These problems are sometimes fixed half a year after the game is released, and sometimes they are never fixed. It is not difficult to imagine what kind of working environment developers face. No criticism, no opinions, just follow the instructions of the leaders. Then this trend will gradually become irreversible. The core developers have left Ubisoft, and I don‚Äôt think they have any way to recruit them back. After all, they have done an even worse mentorship program and recruited people who have no game experience to make games. This disaster has reached a point where they are bankrupt, and it is obvious that management is not aware of this. Assassin's Creed Shadow is a disaster. I have to say that if they made another statement that this is all fiction, players would be able to accept it. But from the moment they claimed that this is a historical figure, it caused public outrage. Whether it is development, design, or marketing, it is a disaster, which is enough to capsize the ship.",2024-09-27T04:12:20Z,0,0

You give absolutely zero fucks about historical accuracy or misrepresenting Japanese culture. None of you know anything about Japanese culture outside of anime.

Yasuke is a person that existed. Whether he was a samurai or not is debated, but his existence is not. AC hasn't been historically accurate ever, much less recently. Apple of Eden, Animus, alternate history, centuries-spanning war between Templars and Assassins? Come on. Now recently you can fight gods. 

Nobody cares about accuracy until a black guy is where he ""shouldn't"" (even though he's valid in being in the time period). What's the issue with playing as a foreigner to the game's setting? Like, actually? Especially when there are TWO protagonist and the other is a native Japanese. Oh wait, she's a woman, doesn't count.

It truly stresses me out how much of a stink is thrown by gamers about everything. Ubisoft is not a good company and it's steeped in actual bad shit like misconduct allegations, but the idea that their worst sin is having a ""woke agenda"" and are ""infiltrated by Sweet Baby Inc."" brother you are a grown ass man.

how both describing the vision or simply not understanding social queues due to being autistic, all the hires thought they were problematic and also saw an opportunity to fuck them over (at first convincing Mike to oust Alex before abandoning him neck deep in debt) and tons of other things, starting with ""we dont want to make unnecessary fan service"" to  ""the fact that we have a group that is literally nazis and originally were supposed to be evil, now that we made the leader a nice empathetic character lets delete the nazi side of her army"".

needless to say the game is slowly loosing its ground and every time a new character gets anounced you can see the slowdown in the fandoms enthusiasm, and the devs dont seem to be receptive to these, thinking that it's how they used to have it, a small fringe fandom that would come back and buy what they made at the drop of a hat, yet every release is middle of the road, or just a huge ""meh"" all because they changed the lore, and deleted a HUGE part of a character's backstory because god forbid her become a villian.",2024-09-27T03:53:49Z,0,0

Its mildly offensive at worst, and sets the expectation that video games can't make fictional stories based on reality *or* use ""offensive"" symbols in the games (Wolfenstein style).

Ever since Assassin's Creed ONE. And they have not deserved anyone's support since 2020, when their executive branch and team leadership was exposed as creating an abusive, toxic environment for their employees. I feel sorry for their developers. The executives don't care about their creative vision, and they don't care about player's experiences.  Yves Guillemot has destroyed Ubisoft.  I LOVED Assassin's Creeed, Alta√Ør, Desmond, Ezio. But Ubisoft is to blame, Yves Guillemot is to blame.

* Pay is worse than everywhere else.  
* People are bored from doing the same things by working in many titles within the same brand
* Problematic projects that sucks from the initial concept and you know that you're technically punished financially to work on them because there's no chance of profitability 
* Editorial was messy before and probably still now but publisher (especially north america's office are utterly incompetent and they are never accountable for their mistakes)

aside from wokescold twitter lefties, the broader left tends to find this stuff annoying at best and gross/ alienating at worst. When it comes to lefty critiques of media, the argument is for representation, not tokenization and this has been long identified as out of touch corporate lib shit that literally nobody is asking for, nor wants, and I think that that can be seen in how nobody actually really defends it. It's good to have games that explore concepts of toxic masculinity, racism, sexism, etc. such as games like wolfenstein (explores male childhood abuse and the struggles men go through as a result of that conditioning, along with racism and sexism, of course), God of war (toooons of interaction with concepts of toxic masculinity and generational trauma), Red Dead Redemption 2 (deals with racism, masculinty, sexism, etc.), and that dialogue doesn't necessarily have to be perfect either, but at least it's happening and goddamn can it hit hard (ngl, wolfenstein legit still sometimes make me cry), and I think people even still appreciate characters who just happen to be of other demographics (Ellie from the last of us 2 just so happens to be a lesbian and I feel like that has very little impact on people's ability to connect with her). That being said there's also still tons of enjoyment in getting to play as a roided up beefcake badass who oonga boonga bonks, tears, an crushes his way through hordes of unfortunate enemies that made the mistake of being in the way after gunther chugged his 5th pre-work out of the day. There's appreciation for all of it, but companies like Ubisoft don't realize that they take away that opportunity for dialogue and inclusion by turning communities of real people and real experiences into one dimensional heteroflexible Jimtilda, patting themselves on the back, and pretending like this is what communities are asking for, then silencing anyone that they're claiming to represent who try to say that they're either not being heard, misrepresented, or having their culture stripped of it's identity, treated like a neat gimmick, and even disrespected (anyone who has any familiarity with japanese history would know that mixing their stuff up with chinese architecture/ history is wiiiiild, aside from genuinely being kinda racist).

Video games are an art form and when it's treated as such, that's when you see success. A good character should have depth and be able to be identified with, regardless of your background. I'd like to think that, even if you don't pick up on all of the subtext, good characters and good stories implant concepts that you take with you and think about after you're done playing the game, saying that it intention isn't to just let loose and annihilate swarms of nids and demons haha. It's no surprise that your company might start dying when you produce things that nobody asked for and nobody wants, since there's no actual audience and nobody wants to buy your game haha.",2024-09-27T03:15:54Z,0,0

But I had experienced that in watchdogs legion and far cry 6. Even watchdogs 2 too if you really focus on some elements of the story.

Games aren't supposed to be made with a political message. Games are supposed to be fun. An escape from reality. 

I had fought off ubishit sheeples in reddit comments when i raised by criticism for watchdogs legion and far cry 6. I warned that ubishit is going down a path that would be disastrous for them. A few years later, i stand corrected.

You know what i would even play a woke game or two. But then there comes the same repetitive checklist type of games created by ubishit. Even if someone is to overlook the woke pandering, the games are just shit. If you focus on the rpg style AC that started with origins, at max you'll play origins and Odyssey. But when you come upto Valhalla, you'll be so bored out of your mind due to the mind numbing checklist type of games.

I didn't even bother with Mirage because i was just done with ubishit.

Whenever a Black character takes center stage, it seems like they are unfairly targeted. I genuinely can‚Äôt recall a single game featuring a Black protagonist that has been appreciated without some backlash. It feels like people latch onto every little mistake, searching for something to criticize, often before they‚Äôve even given the game a chance.

For example, when Miles Morales was introduced, there was a wave of hate focused on the art style and various details in the movie. I can't help but think this mindset is deeply rooted in racism. Why weren‚Äôt there similar complaints about any Ubisoft game until they introduced a Black character?

It put into light just how poorly & toxic Ubisoft are run. It's painful for me because I am an Assassin's Creed creator. I love Assassin's Creed. NOT Ubisoft... Seeing them make these terrible and stupid decisions just doesn't make sense. The torii gate, the zoro sword, the chines architecture, the stolen flag, the hip-hop music. It's almost like why? Why do this? Everything could've been avoided if they just sat down and thought about it properly. I don't mind Yasuke. I find the character interesting. But I am not blind to the fact that once again, this could've been avoided had they just added a japanese samurai. It's almost like they are intentionally making bad decisions after bad decisions to essentially create angry interest.

You mentioned it in the video. Ubisoft can't cannot take risks anymore without offending workers or higher-ups, so they play it safe as shown with the mediocrity of Star Wars Outlaws. I remember just how brutal and risky the Pazzi conspiracy was in AC2. I remember Far Cry 3 taking a risk with Citra ra***ng Jason Brody during the hallucination, I remember how risky AC1 was buring religous books.. Risks risks risks. Well written stories and actual passion was put into these games. Origins was the last AC game that truly was memorable to me. That was 7 years ago.

I have worked with Ubisoft as a test player several times , they have a program you can sign up to in France ( i don't know if it takes place in others country but i would assume it does).  
Basically goes like this , you are called on your cell phone , a date is chosen and they give your Ubisoft connect a special ""game"" to remotely play from your home on one of their computer. 
A bit like teamviewer but you only control the game and can't alt+tab which make sense. 
You are in a discord call with other testers and some devs during the testing , it usually take place on a 6 to 8 hours period, 3/4 hours before moon and 3/4 hours after.
I won't say which specific games i tested since i signed a non disclosure agreement. They make you play a very early game version with loads of missing stuff, for exemple no dialogues, musics,no hairs on characters etc.
After every 3/4 period of play time you are asked to fill up a questionnaire and gives vocal feedback to the devs you are with.

And i can say this, after several times working with this company i stopped answering to playtest invitation. I litteraly feel like NONE of the feedback i gave were used or taken into account , had a conversation not too long ago with other playtesters and they felt the exact same way. I really feel sad for this company , 10 to 15 years ago we were proud to have a huge succesful company that came from France and made good games.

It completely blows my mind how insanely stupid these developers are, that they repeatedly make the same braindead decisions. Look at Baldur‚Äôs Gate 3. 

Freedom of choice. Excellent character development and design. Beautiful storytelling. Jaw-dropping graphics. Immaculate world design. Graphic nudity, Violence and Language. Nothing held back, nothing played safe.

How hard is it to just follow that formula? Why is it so insanely difficult to give players what they actually want?",2024-09-27T01:49:08Z,0,0

You make many EXTREMELY legitimate points and criticisms about Ubisoft (i.e. its toxic corporate culture, its mediocre games, and the faus pax it made involving Japanese culture). But for all those legit points, you then fall into the trap of labeling depictions of 'diverse' and 'non-hot' characters as problems. As if including women and black people are a mistake.   

Diversity is not the problem. You understand that the true evil isn't diversity and political correctness, but the big capitalists using those things as a means for profit; thus causing diversity to be expressed poorly. That's the enemy there. Not fucking DEI, woke or 'Sweet Baby Inc', or whatever words 90% of your commenters use every time they see a skin color/gender they hate, or anytime they see a woman that's not 'hot' enough. 

I'm going to say it: regardless of however Ubisoft might fuck up their game with cultural inaccuracy, Yasuke is cool. He was a big tall foreigner thrown into an environment unlike his own, and somehow rubbed shoulders and found favor with one of the most famous historic figures in Japanese history, during one of the nation's most infamous warring periods. He's an interesting character, and god forbid we have ONE samurai game set in Warring States Japan where you can play a historic non-Japanese character. 

I'll say this too: I won't ever touch Star Wars Outlaws, but anyone who thinks the protagonist looks ugly must REALLY not like 1980s Sigourney Weaver. She looks fine. Not every single woman in video games or Star Wars has to look like a supermodel or fucking bimbo. Not that it's bad when they do (Lady Dimitrescu and Bayonetta, by gawd), but not EVERY woman. If you want hot women in your games all the time, you can go browse the Hentai category on Steam. 

Also, I'll add this as a fellow millennial. If someone at my workplace throws out the word 'retard' on the regular like punctuation, I'm not going to be comfortable associating with the guy. I'll give him the benefit of a doubt, and maybe ask him to tone it down. I'd even be fine if the guy excuses it as a personal tick, while making an effort to stop using the word. 
But if the guy doesn't just refuse to stop, but gets ANGRY at the mere suggestion to stop? Then I'm assuming the man has no sense of respecting people. Just some angry asshole who thinks everyone's out for his ass, because he thinks it's impossible to criticise something without dropping a slur for autistic/neurodivergent people.
The oppression in a workplace like Ubisoft's is one thing. But in saner everyday spaces, it's called being fucking polite. If you think the opposite of toxic positivity should be equally toxic negativity, then you're just on the far end of another spectrum of assholery.",2024-09-27T00:51:08Z,0,0

Blaming HR for games being bad or boring is a little like blaming the bus driver if other passengers are being annoying. It sucks that you had bad experiences with that shit (I did too), but there are more obvious places to look for explanations (or cast blame). There are systemic problems with the way big games are in these companies (process, tool, management). These processes were tuned to make games that suited a particular business model which doesn't work as well anymore, but they can't adjust because the companies literally grew around them. They need one of two things to fight this amount inertia A) really exemplary leadership (haha) B) a better idea, and that's not happening either. That's why they are chasing trends the way they are, they're just waiting for somebody to come up with the next big thing. Pretty sad in Ubisoft's case considering their history.

To start off‚Ä¶ Oof. 22 minutes of a grown man throwing a temper tantrum. Yikes. And you recorded, edited, and uploaded it. Okay.
For someone who harps on people being sensitive, overreacting, and being hostile towards freedom of thought. You really are the perfect evidence to your own point, huh? Though, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs just a product of your upbringing.

You know what else was a product of your upbringing? A blatant avoidance of introspection and mindfulness. Have you ever contemplated why that word may offend someone? I know you prefer to regurgitate the same tired, philosophically absent catchphrases from 2017 rather than form a personality or perspective, but try your hardest to think why it can offend someone.

I‚Äôll help with 3 hypotheticals to inspire your child‚Äôs brain in a grown man‚Äôs body to become mature, respectful, and empathetic (though I‚Äôm sure you define these traits as toxic positivity)
1. They have a family member with an intellectual disability. If they‚Äôre low-functioning and require constant medical care, the parents‚Äô love and sorrow are evident as their child is hospitalized frequently, undergoing painful treatments, and unable to play just like all the other children. Financial instability also looms, as they struggle to afford medical bills for someone they love.
2. The person you banned was on the spectrum. They loved your content, felt like they were a part of the community you built, then you ‚Äúunconsciously‚Äù said what you did. They would probably feel pretty dismissed and blindsided. They just wanted to escape reality like everyone else, have some fun watching games. Instead, you used a disability to describe something negatively. Attributing a word to a negative. Remind you of anything? hint: Someone in 1963 had something to say about doing that same thing to marginalize others.
3. The horrifying history of how people with disabilities were treated. Learn the reason these laws were passed. PARC v Pennsylvania (1971), Mills v. Board of Education of District of Columbia (1972), O'Connor v. Donaldson (1975), Youngberg v. Romeo (1982), City of Cleburne, Texas v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc. (1985), Ford v. Wainwright (1986), Olmstead v. L.C. (1999), PGA Tour, Inc. v. Martin (2001), Spector v. Norwegian Cruise Line Ltd. (2005).

They actively want to get others in trouble for the smallest things, and they actively want to ""feel offended"" and they actively want to save others that dont even need saving from evil with that obnoxious hero complex that they suffer from.
They have literally nothing else to do with their time, than to police people in what they say now and what they said in the past.
What's worse is that they refuse to give you an actual list of what you cannot say. When asked they just reply that ""anything that would be offensive."" It is completely arbitrary. It can be offensive to them but not to anyone else in the group, or it can be offensive to everyone but not to the problem player (it is rare that the problem player is not offended but I reckon it can happen). It is completely and 100% arbitrary so it is impossible to watch your language. Something that is ""wrong"" will slip. A wrong word. A wrong emoji. A wrong quotation.

Everyone who's played the original Dark Souls knows Gwynevere, and her glorious bonhonagahoogs. According to game director Miyazaki, the giant boobage was the artist's idea, not his, but the aritst was so clearly happy with the design that Miyazaki didn't have the heart to ask him to change it. And so, ""Amazing chest ahead"" was born.
Creativity thrives in an environment like that.

Be HONEST..did u REALLY think it would get THIS soft? We had PLENTY of folks who had the special classes, they may have had mental or physical deficits, but honestly we treated em EXACTLY like we would ANYONE else. These softer generations don't seem to even fully understand, it typically makes people like that, MORE uncomfortable, to have people make a BIG deal about their ""deficits"", I know I sure as sh** would want folks to treat me the same as everyone else. If anything, the person doin the bullying, would catch a fight, back before guys got expelled for little skirmish level fights.  You'd catch a few days of in-school suspension, but now, if u happen to fight someone & they lose, they can go to their parents, teachers, principal, hell sometimes even Law enforcement, To report a ""hate crime"". If someone ran their mouth too much, it got ""handled"". I never realized @ the time, it wasn't far off from a prison-type environment, not even necessarily in a ""bad"" way, it just shares many of the same things. Funny how I don't see those same soft kids, or slightly older adults w/the minds of children, NEVER see em tryin to stop people from blaspheming. We simply called people who were acting weird of EXTRA soft, ""gay"", or if we saw somethin that just didn't make sense, we would say ""I'm sorry, but that's retarded"". I get that younger folks, allow words to destroy their delicate sensibilities, but they're WORDS. It's even protected, as ""free speech"", although now, of course, even THAT is not for debate (complaining from safe places). People have nearly meaningless lives, so they attach themselves to ""causes"", attempting to inflate their broken will/ego. Things ran like CLOCKWORK for our generation, if ya stepped outta line, ya paid the price. Now, it's like there's hardly ANY ""normal"" people, & I would happily say any of this, to basically ANYONE'S face, unless you're like 6ft. 8 & 300 lbs, & built like Ray Lewis or somethin, in that case, I suppose you get a ""pass"" lol. It's honestly just sad, to see not only gaming, but just culture in general, get deflated into almost nothingness, & the overwhelming majority don't even seem to mind. Other than technology, that gets better EVERY generation, name ONE thing that has TRULY improved in the world? Good luck w/that. Other countries don't even HAVE the OPPORTUNITY for free speech, yet here, sad little cowardly whiners wanna bitch & complain, over WORDS. If words get to you, THAT much, u probably ought 2 just stay FAR away from the Internet, or online gaming, if that's all it takes to ""hurt you"". Other countries, Sudan, Ethiopia, people don't even know where their next meal is coming from, struggling even w/getting clean water or BASIC medicine to keep themselves/their children alive...yet here's the ENDLESS, pathetic, SAD little cowards who can't handle WORDS . Seriously, u need to grow up, & develop tougher skin, hearing words, does NOT qualify as a ""hardship"". We get it, u were raised soft, & expect the rest of the world üåé, to be JUST as soft as u are, it's just not. You'll have to overcome, this ""deficit"". We had NO issues dealing w/kids who had mental or physical deficits, but Y'ALL do. We treated em like we would ANYONE else, someone might make a joke or be a little inappropriate, but we did that w/EVERYONE. Typically, those kids wanna be treated JUST like the rest of us, NOT excluded or havin people point out their problems, or mental/physical issues. As for the games, I've basically boycotted Ubisoft, WAYYY 2 many disappointments. Far Cry 1 & 2 were SO much different, more immersion. Black flag, the new one had like 200 concurrent players, from a self-proclaimed ""AAAA"" (Quadruple A) studio, even though the entire POINT of that ""system"", is based on credit ratings, that only go as high as triple-A, defeating even the NOTION of needing a
 ""Quadruple 4"" rating, it's just something some person within their public relations dept. Came up with, to be able to make it look like their job is necessary. Watchdogs, MASSIVE disappointment. The Division, MASSIVE disappointment, Avatar...Avatarded, Star Wars Outlaws, outside of the hub world that is next to empty, could be ANY other game, only a small amount of time & effort went into the Star Wars ""theme"". They have a toxic work environment, no innovation or free-thinking, bc larger studios have more mouths to feed. You can pretty much bat that any game that is publicly traded on the stock market, has a TRUE, fiscal responsibility to their shareholders, to make as much as as possible for investors, but NO obligation WHATSOEVER, to ""make the best possible game"" or ""most fun game possible"". Now, anything successful gets sequels, remakes, new editions, whatever, bc the bigger corporations just wanna get a return on investment, nothin more. There's a little more to it, but that's basically it, the world üåé as a whole, got soft, dumb, & inexplicably ""proud"" to be weak-minded fools, or complainers...but ONLY from the safest places, MAYBE 1-2% MIGHT say it to the persons face. The üåé world as a whole, just seems content, to watch everything get WORSE as time goes along, which truly confuses me, as to why they try to push the idea that humanity is ""evolving"" over time. Technology might be, but good LUCK üëç naming anything else, that gets better each year, rather than worse. Oh well, @ least us older folks had a few good years, I GENUINELY feel bad for most younger folks, who seem to miss ALL the most important parts of life by a COUNTRY MILE...But can't seen to manage hearing words, it's just more than their tiny üíî heart & soul, can bare",2024-09-27T00:12:07Z,0,0

There's also a saying between trees in the Prairie --- If a giant falls, the shade is gone, and that patch of land is forever lost to grass. Are we in the Jungle or in the Prairie? We do not know. Probably somewhere in-between. That is why with Ubisoft, deep-down, we are all very conflicted. We want saplings to grow, but we don't want the biggest shade-provider to die that suddenly, it does NOT sound like a safe thing to do, even for the saplings. As much as each sapling crave for more resource for photosynthesis, everyone knows UV light KILLS, PERIOD. As a gamer, the best scenario is if Ubisoft can somehow steer itself back on a neutral path, no question about it, regardless of your inclinations. But if not... Now it gets interesting.

There have been 0 of both in the franchise.  There wouldn't have been Chinese architecture being shown off in the game's first gameplay trailer if AC Shadows had actually cared about Japanese history or even the Japanese perspective.  Ubi isn't DEI.  Ubi is cosplaying DEI while selling the same repetitive trash in different skins.  This isn't DEI.  This is rainbow capitalism and tokenism.


Rant below:

A DEI company would have actually consulted with multiple Japanese historians on every single step of the way from world design, to character representation, and even down to the script for the story to ensure that the Japanese perspective would be shown to the fullest.  Sucker Punch did this with Ghost of Tsushima.  Ubisoft is literally more than 100x bigger than Sucker Punch (160 employees vs  19,000), has more resources, AC is one of their few franchises that hasn't been killed somehow, it and can take all the time it wants to do it too. There is no good reason for their products to be worse with that level of manpower.  

 The problem with gaming isn't DEI. This isn't a culture war as much as alt-right nuts like to try to steer people into thinking. The problem with gaming is that greedy companies will cosplay being DEI while still trying to nickel and dime the player at every single opportunity.   Simultaneously, the games these greedy companies put out are all the same minimum viable product possible because the CEOs want the money quickly, so they can get more stock buybacks.  Inflating the value of their own companies, and giving themselves fat bonuses year round after making record profits year over year.  All while laying off their own dedicated workers by the literal hundreds after they're used up and broken by abusive workplace practices and no union representation.  

The problem with Triple A, Ubisoft, and every major company since 2016 isn't companies are being forced to include black and brown people into workplaces when we've constantly been excluded for no reason other than skin color.   The problem is that huge companies are lazy AND greedy.  They're too lazy to pursue true representation or to even say anything that can be construed as different with their products.  Look at Watch Dogs Legion.  That game had an unique mechanic and a punk take on London literally right after Brexit happened.  Punk is literally about going against the political status quo because the flaws in said system, and Ubi thought it was a good idea to sand every political edge or implication off the ""play as anyone"" mechanic and story mid-development. As a cherry on top, the game came out broken as well.  The reason the game came out like that at all was because Ubisoft was too greedy, it was so hungry for the short term profit, that it sent the game out before it was actually even ready.  Same thing happened with Valhalla as well.",2024-09-26T23:24:27Z,0,0

Arquitetura, detalhes de vestimentas, uso de termos, tudo isso pode ser perdoado dependendo do contexto - √© apenas um jogo, uma obra ficcional. Claro que seria melhor contratar profissionais que pudessem contextualizar, explicar, tentar deixar o mais cr√≠vel poss√≠vel (ao exemplo de Ghost of Tsushima/Yotei) - afinal de contas, n√£o temos m√°quinas do tempo e muito do que se foi jamais ser√° sequer de nosso conhecimento, certas tradi√ß√µes se perderam e muitas coisas foram esquecidas, infelizmente.

N√£o vejo com bons olhos exageros, uso de armas estranhas, pois o apelo desse jogo √© muito simples: cultura japonesa. N√£o precisamos de massas gigantescas super adornadas, lan√ßas cerimoniais usadas como armas, etc. Tamb√©m seria estranho se represent√°ssemos historicamente os samurai - lutando com arcos e lan√ßas, raramente usando espadas, apenas quando a batalha j√° havia se tornado ca√≥tica. 
No entanto, com todas essas ressalvas, muitos ""ataques √† Ubisoft"" s√£o t√£o sem prop√≥sito quanto usar bots para coment√°rios positivos. A figura de Yasuke √© real, mas quase nada se sabe sobre ele, algo que a franquia sempre se aproveitou - lacunas hist√≥ricas. Nesse sentido ele pode ser um samurai, mesmo sem ter sido de fato (o que n√£o podemos afirmar). Tudo pelo bem da divers√£o, o que deveria ser o foco de todos os jogos.


Divers√£o, qualidade, √© o que espero do jogo - mas come√ßo a me preocupar seriamente ap√≥s o adiamento (e do lan√ßamento de Star Wars Outlaws, que n√£o gostei da qualidade do jogo, das mec√¢nicas, da f√≠sica, n√£o ficou legal).",2024-09-26T23:11:21Z,0,0

If a company loses all its managers, stuff will still get done.  It'll be inefficient and sloppy and whatever, but the product will still get made and sold.  If a company loses all its line workers, it's out of business, period.  Ergo, the actual workers have more value to the company than the management does.  So why is management paid better when they're less essential to making money?

The entire concept makes no sense.  And it has never made sense.  This aspect of work isn't new.  But it has never, ever made sense that a low level manager makes more money than the people below him.  If anything, the lowest level of management should make less than the box boy does.  Management shouldn't pay even as much as the workers until you're at least site manager.  Once you're managing the entire store/factory/etc., at least you're doing a noticable amount of work and you provide some value to the company.

Sure, the protagonist of Starwars Outlaws has a chin ""I"" wouldn¬¥t consider attractive but she isn¬¥t an ugly charakter, while the protagonist from Stellar Blade i wouldnt consider a attractive Charakter because she looks like a a 08/15 korean MMO female charakter. Also i consider Tifa and Aerith from the FF7 Remakes as attractive. But the thing is, its also depends on the ""style"" of a game. FF7 is stylized, Stellar Blade is stylized, Star Wars Outlaws is realistic and that means you will face realistic charakters which means also ugly or not perfect at least. Aloy¬¥s Face from Horizon could be described as masculine or even fat. But she is still attractive. Thats the curse of realistic graphics over stylized graphics. The female hero from the Fable trailer is considered ugly and i would agree, but it¬¥s Fable. And non of the earlier titles in the series have good looking charakters, and thats not a problem with the graphics of their time, it¬¥s a style and design choice for a game about moralic behave and how it changes your appearance as well. Your Body, your Temple. Don¬¥t get me wrong, i really don¬¥t understand what¬¥s the problem, because attractiveness is subjective. And i only talked about faces, not about anything else.

And more options to customize your body in games with custom charakters, is allways good. I do not use 9/10 options because i don¬¥t like them most of the time in such games and do not complain that this 9/10 exist including male bodytypes ^^"" But more options are allways good because it allows to create the charakter you want to play, even if that options are not for anyone attractive.",2024-09-26T23:01:00Z,0,0

This involved producing minimal or repetitive content, speeding up release cycles, and implementing microtransactions. As a result, many industry-leading game developers lost the trust of the gaming community. While customers learn very slowly, they do eventually catch on, and over time, many once-promising IPs collapsed despite their potential to remain profitable assets for the companies.

I don't want Ubisoft to die, but it will happen. This company was killed by wokeness, it feels like every new game has undergone the Sweet Baby Inc treatment to make everything soft, politically super correct and with this - as an result - becoming more and more predictable and boring. Wokeness and DEI agenda follows strikt guidelines, and that's the death of any creativity. Ubisoft can survive this, but they have to remove all activists from their development studios, they have to get rid of any DEI consultants and have to get rid of political correctness. They also have to inject masculinity back into their games and their development studios, because the majority of players on PC and consoles (not smartphones) are male.

Now I doubt that, unless most of the team left, Ghost Of... Fuck some mountain in Hokaido I think, will be nearly as bad as AC Shadows is.
That said, Ghost Of Tsushima won a bunch of awards and was beloved by Japan. Some of the devs were even named embroiders of Tsushima island. You heard right, devs of the original game were given political status in recognition for their respect for the island's history and culture, that they showed in their historical fiction story. Contrast this with how Shadows is being received over there, I don't care how much better Ghost Of... Is, Any comparison to Shadows by making it woke that that will hurt this game and the studio quite a bit. It's likely not even their fault, Sony likely had mandates that they had to follow when this game was being developed.
It's also hilarious to me that they moved the clock so far forward, like over 300 years, to a time that is much more stable in Japan. There was a lot more you could do with post Mongol invasion, warring clans, samurai maybe digging up some of those old iconic Mongol weapons as they stray from the honorable path and you must follow their lead once again for survival. Nope, none of that. This is set in Edo period, likely just to paint the ""Europeans bad"" angle. Also, without that active war, you can't give the same stakes to the story and thus the character choosing to go down the path of the ghost is much less meaningful of a struggle.",2024-09-26T22:31:03Z,0,0

Then over time, I started to notice in the intro screens messages about the game being made by a team with various religious faiths and beliefs, and I thought Okay, whatever. then it was a multicultural team with various religious faiths and beliefs, then a multicultural team with various faiths, beliefs, sexual orientations, and gender identities, and I thought to myself 'Who the hell cares about any of this?' Does the actual end user ever give a crap about any of this identity politics crap? I mean sure the increasingly liberal game review mags will lap it up and the corporate shills will love it but what about the whole reason why the industry even exists in the first place? The gamers? Do they give a flying monkey's ass if the people who develop their games have their hands in every sector of identity politics known to man? I sure as heck don't. And I noticed as these messages got longer, and longer the quality of their games started to decrease steadily until now they are nearly unrecognizable from what they once were.

Along with ditching monetization schemes the industry needs to ditch the DEI and ESG initiatives because the actual end users are getting sick of it. The video game industry was MADE into a multi-billion dollar entertainment industry by passionate developers who made high-quality enjoyable products and is being driven into the ground by greedy corporations looking to drain every last dollar from their customers' wallets while paying lip service to ID politics. It's like a vampire that is sucking the life out of this industry and once the gaming industry is well and truly dead they'll just move onto their next victim.",2024-09-26T22:08:58Z,0,0

Second there are this big other games, and in 3 Month they cannot fix the problems, they can double check all Kanji and in the very best cast fix some architecture or fix the Torii gates, but no major changes are possible in this time frame. So even if they try to pump up the sales to bring the game on on Steam ect. may not lead to the numbers they need. So put the release between 2 other major releases give them the opportunity to play the blame game ""its the fault of these other games ours don't performed as good as it would"".

And thus began the legend of the Black Samurai. A real guy who did exist and lived a life all modern Japanese folk have heard about.

AC Shadows has two main protagonist characters. A Japanese ninja assassin and the Japanese equivalent of having Ben Franklin in the AC game set in the American Revolutionary War.

AC Shadows is going to suck. It's going to suck because it's an open world ubisoft game. It's not going to suck because white Western nazis don't know Japanese history and don't want to see black characters. 

Ubisoft games suck because the corporate leadership is full of sex pests and retired war criminals. Ubisoft games suck because the toxic workspace created by the bigots sheltered by the C Suite makes life hell for the workers. 

Ubisoft games do not suck because the DEI boogeyman and ""positivity"" have ""ruined the sanctity of the creative process.""",2024-09-26T21:43:31Z,0,3

The descent from an industry leading and innovative game studio to a soulless woke-driven company is sad to watch. I remember, I talked with devs that were involved with AC and AC2 back then, and they were always so excited when they talked about the future and a possible AC in Japan. They were so fixated on historic accuracy and innovative ways to implement new gameplay mechanic. I remember their discussion about ideas for a Ninja AC character and they were so sure, that it would become a milestone AC-Game in the franchise just because Ninjas and the Hashassins of the orient were so alike and all the possibilities for good storytelling and gameplay mechanics. Well, they are not with Ubisoft anymore and I like to believe they look at their former company today and think: ""How the hell can you mess up this golden opportunity and dissappoint all players with that garbage?""

Using one of my favorite games, BG3, as example: Karlack is one of those cases for me: I'd much prefer her not to be a larger but cute red woman but a monstrouous behemoth disfigured ih hell. This something Ferra/Tor from Mortal Kombat X, or even someone witl one more arm, etc. But BG3 has the opposite issue, the mandatory romances made your whole entourage at least palatable - add to this the mandatory ""one of every race"" and there is no space for actually COOL companions - so we get no half orc, no dwarf, no actually monstruous war machine Karlack, etc.

Now the opposite effect, using CP2077 expansion, Shadow Liberty: You have a wheelchair bound hacker and noone feels it's silly or artificial inclusivity. Why? Not only the dude is a villain but incredibly ugly and the design is COOL AF.  They also added an asian chick and a black dude as pivotal characters and noone call it DEI. Why? Great writting and performance by Idris Elba Elba.

In the end of the day, using all those corpo buzzwords just make even harder to make a great game, like any other limitation. Thing is, Ubisoft let go talent to reach quotas, and that makes creating good games hard and basically impossible if you add DEI and other safety measures.",2024-09-26T21:30:54Z,0,0

Maybe it negatively impacts sales in Japan.  As a Chinese person growing up in the US, I am all too familiar with Western lack of respect and disregard for eastern cultures.

However, I can't get behind this whiny entitlement from gamers.  They are video games.  Planes are not crashing from the sky and killing people like when corporate greed at Boing is rampant.  Please get a sense of perspective.  Nothing epitomizes Western culture more, in my opinion, than your disrespectful attitude of entitlement, as if other people should serve you if you have money and are paying for a product or a service.

I've been playing video games since Pong and Adventure on the Atari 2600.  I've played just about every genre of game, and while I am not myself a game developer, I am a software developer and my wife is in the gaming industry (artist).  So it's not like I have anything against gaming or the industry.  But I don't think game devs OR their studios need to feel badly about getting things wrong.  Gamers can provide feedback, but the game makers don't OWE gamers anything, certainly not the public apology you imply you're asking for.  Either you buy their product and like it, or you don't.  Vote with your wallet.   Most retailers have a policy where you can return games you don't like within a certain time period.  The way gamers go the forums and post whatever the insults they please is the REAL TOXICITY here.  You act as if the people creating these games are not people and should be lynched because they did not properly research their target culture.

People didn't have a problem with completely made up characters with absolutely no historical relevance whatsoever, it makes no sense to have a problem with it now. Additionally, portraying him as a Samurai isn't incorrect, because we don't actually know whether he was one. What we do know is that he handled a lot of tasks that were typically done by Samurai, and was strongly favored by Oda Nobunaga, even to the point of being given land.
Aside from that, the games routinely mythologize the historical figures it works with, such as Da Vinci and the Medici family. Same with the borgias or Washington or Lee. The series has always exaggerated the historical figures in its various settings, even from the very beginning of the series.

The rap is a bad choice, but I get what they're going for with it. They're using music to emphasize him being a fish out of water, drawing attention to how alien this environment feels to him. The problem is twofold, for one the music they chose does a terrible job of communicating that, and the second problem is that rap has nothing to do with the culture he would've been from and is extremely anachronistic.",2024-09-26T21:17:42Z,0,0

But Ubisoft forgot that when you do anything vaguely representing Japense history that you will need to focus on the purely authentic. Instead they doubled down on the DEI and the US social political beliefs instead of making something authentic. They just went full on trying to market their shit with no respect of what some of the symbolism might mean. That symbolism may not mean much in some parts of the world but in Japan... It's just not OK. They didn't source the right people.

You banning the person who raised you saying Ret*d is pretty much the same as HR pulling people in for an ! (arguably worse because Ret*d has become offensive). 

It is possible to reflect, research, change and grow. Emotional reaction to criticism is understandable but then acting from that emotional place is not always the best idea. 

Context does matter and I think public figures need to be more aware of their use of language. Just because you don't think it's offensive, doesn't mean that there are those in your audience who do think it is due to their history with the word being used against them. More importantly, those people aren't likely to speak up either as they are - rightly - afraid of then being targeted e.g. you banning the person who bought it up. Instead, they'll just leave your space. 

This stuff isn't black and white, the extreme examples can be ridiculed but there is value in nuance and discussions around language use and how it can include/exclude/hurt/help people.",2024-09-26T20:57:22Z,0,0

There does need to be some level of friction and conflict/resolution in order to make any sort of quality product.

However, call me crazy but I find it a bit hypocritical that the ideal being presented in the topic of this video is ""there needs to be some level of friction and dissent to better ourselves"" and then you turn around and tell us about how you insta-banned someone from your stream chat because they called you out in one of the most _mild_ ways I've ever seen as an example of how people are ""waiting to be offended."" Nothing about this sits right with me.

I'm not going to assert that nobody is like that (I definitely have dealt with people that have victim complexes), but I will assert that many of these folks, including the one you banned, is just going about their business and they hear a word or phrase that feels like they felt a gross, unexpected crunch while chewing on something soft. Instabanning someone for a callout, as sick of it as you might be, sends a message of ""I'm right, you're wrong, f--- off."" The more graceful way of handling it is to go ""Not often at all. My bad, I slipped up"" and move on. If that person continues giving you shit for it, then you know they're a bad actor looking to be cause problems and you ban them then.",2024-09-26T20:56:33Z,0,0

Ninjas should have been like the 3rd installment... They waited too long (because of racism, trust me) and now when they're at the bottom of the barrel and finally do Japan, the society has become too culture-sensitive to accept anything but perfect representation of a culture. 

Think about it this way - If they made the first ACs today, wouldn't they have the exact same backlash about mis-representing whatever Arab nation it was meant to be happening in? People weren't outrage-mining back then. They missed the chance to do Japan without this kind of backlash ages ago... Only themselves to blame on that one.

This is done in order to save money (junior dudes cost less than an old, senior worker), then these managers can write on their CV that ""they enhanced the company's incomes during their period there"", but the company is obviously doomed to fail.

Both because they want to generate outrage marketing.  But also because they genuinely want to spit in the face of the consumers and exert their dominance.  A rep from Sweet Baby Inc recently came out and admitted this.  But we can look at internal videos from Disney and many other companies going back 10+ years for the same thing.

What's different now is that the DEI money is drying up.  In the past, the DEI money they got front loaded before releasing the game made up for lost sales.  But suddenly this year, the shareholders and hedge funds have stopped giving that money.  So they have these games that have been in the pipeline for 3-5 years and they have to release them with the old model.  Everyone from Disney to Warner Bros to Sony to Ubisoft are scrambling to change course.  But they still have years worth of DEI projects to get through.  And activists to fire.

What point is there gloating about a perceived victory when the communication was lost?

There's diversity and variety in both characters and the culture in general but it doesn't limit the gameplay opportunities. Also there's a difference between having diversity and having forced diversity. When watching the latest Disney movies for instance (heck even the latest Transformers movie) it's so blatantly obvious the cast was selected based on ethnicity and then they tried to find ways to have it make sense for the story.,2024-09-26T20:31:57Z,0,0

I recently got into Jubilee, but it‚Äôs not to get angry and argue with people, I legit learned some stuff from  people on the show I disagree with, or thought I disagreed with? Of course I have specific opinions I‚Äôm not going to change (Like I‚Äôm not going to suddenly think fetus‚Äô are worth more than women‚Äôs health care) but I learned more about trans experiences and opinions that are both pro and anti the military ban, or about how easily certain things have been accessible to them.

And even if DURING the debate itself, when people become more defensive and end up arguing (which I can be like during conversations like this) a lot of the time afterwards I will reflect on what they said and do some more research. 

I‚Äôve only watched ones up to a year ago, but I personally think I‚Äôm getting a lot of benefit, especially when I live in a media bubble because of how the internet works, it‚Äôs legitimately hard for me to find voices I disagree with to hear them that aren‚Äôt the top voices (like I can find Alex jones and Ben Shapiro, but I want to hear from smaller people who don‚Äôt have the same talking points every time)

I would like to add that I think games should have customizable characters, including gender and pronouns. I'm saying this because how a person wants to represent themselves doesn't affect anybody else's game.

Where I draw the line, is misrepresenting people in history. Yasuke was not a Samari. Sure, he can be a fictional character in a fictional game, but this is Japan. The IP for Assassin's Creed is playing as a character from their respective culture (Origins: Egyptian, Valhalla: Viking, Odyssey: Greek etc).

idiot and stupid were once medical terms as well, but just like with R they were used as playground insults and new terms were made. the exact same thing as what happening now. the R word was used as a generic insult and abandoned. its in the exact same position as 'stupid' and 'idiot' yet people don't get their panties in a bunch when they hear those words. why is it any different than the R word?",2024-09-26T20:03:28Z,0,0

They got me back with 4 and Unity but the bugs were so bad in unity I was just done. They've gotten more lazy over the course of the years copying Witcher 3 blatantly and it was alright would've been better if they named the games something other than assassins creed but they were ok but got formulaic fast and were taking out content to sell you later like skins and weapons and executions.  

They were making Beyond good and evil 2 which honestly looked amazing and innovative which is crazy for Ubisoft but apparently they canned it I guess because we haven't seen anything for it anymore which is nuts because they spent so much money on that game. The pirate game also would've been cool to play a pirate game with my friends which is just a not cartoony sea of thieves with AC ship combat and just not garbage melee combat but they just released AC4 without any of the other gameplay besides ship stuff. Horribly managed company they suck balls, more worried about jumping through hoops to have a black guy in a game (which people have been wanting to play a Japanese guy for decades) than improving their dogwater combat system, I mean they did the black Viking in Valhalla for no reason as well the whitest race on the planet lol.",2024-09-26T20:02:49Z,0,0

I'd speculate that due to longer lead times, the gaming industry will be a couple years behind industries like advertising and Hollywood in the inevitable pivot. I'd claim Hollywood is already turning the ship. Twisters without any self-righteous speech about climate change. Deadpool & Wolverine and not Deadpool, Wolverine, Their Toxic Masculinity, and Mary Sue. In fact, I think I heard something about a BS toxic masculinity-themed scene being cut from that film before it was released. Sign of the times. The blockbuster hits so far in 2024 show you can push society forward in positive directions without playing up disgusting (imo) politics. Inside Out 2 was at the top of the chart last I checked, and while I haven't seen it, the idea that you can deal sensitively with the human condition does not require pushing an idea of the human condition that is unrecognizable to most actual human beings. I think most people would argue that it's impossible to deal with the human condition if you end up distorting it, in fact. I'm pretty confident the gaming industry is going to pivot, too.

I was not aware of Yasuke's existence. And considering Ubisoft's choices lately, I had chocked it up to ""We put a black main character in and disregarded historic accuracy, but if you're offended by this, you're clearly racist."". Though it STILL feels like their reasoning, just with a different fuel.

I feel like Ubisoft is just making bold choices to be controversial, but in such a way where you look like the bad guy for being annoyed by it.

I have NO issue with black characters in games. I think diversity in gaming is part of what makes it good. If every character in a game was a white guy with blond hair, it'd be bland. But modern game devs need to also learn that every character being a mixed race they/them is ALSO bland. I'd also like to say - as a member of the LGBTQ community - I feel insulted MORE by the shoehorned inclusion JUST to sell a game. A character cannot be a good character on the grounds that they're gay. They have to actually have a reason to be good. IDGAF who they're interested in, that doesn't effect their skills, like guys, like girls, be asexual, idgaf you do you, but you have to have substance. Unless these things play into their character in a major way - maybe your MC is gay, but is from a town who's laws/traditions shame and exile gay people. A strong narrative like that can make you feel your character's motive. Rather than ""This is MC, he is gay, he likes men. He likes me. That is all. He likes men. Oh I guess she goes on adventures too."".

Replace ""gay"" with anything, your MC could be white, black, hispanic, straight, gay, bi, ace, so on. As long as they aren't banking on their skin color or their sexual orientation as their only redeeming feature. This is the BIGGEST issue plaguing modern gaming, I think.

Games were so much more inclusive back when they weren't trying to be. Metroid is an amazing example of this. Metroid 1's manual teases that Samus is a man. Tells you that she's a guy the entire time. You're not really caring, I don't think, it's a cool game. Then you beat the game and find out that this badass you've been playing the entire time is a woman. Samus EARNED her place as a strong female protag. Meanwhile you can guarantee that any game with a female protag NOW is just gonna put it in your face that she's strong, and never give you  reason to believe it.

I want representation and inclusion in gaming, I genuinely do. But I don't like what we're stuck with right now. I shouldn't like a character because I'm gonna be seen as racist/sexist/homophobic for disliking them. I should like a character because I like them.",2024-09-26T19:53:45Z,0,4

For the ¬´¬†leader / designer / engineer that never played the kind of game they are trying to sell¬†¬ª i can just agree with that, well not everyone; but if just the top 10% taking decisions on the production haven‚Äôt ever played a game of the kind they are making, well, it won‚Äôt be good for sure

Another thing is maybe the techdebts accumulated over years and years of bad decisions, our engines, we are forced to use are like, 5 or 10 years late on concurent engines, and the main work force is mostly invested on production instead of engines; because engines don‚Äôt directly make money‚Ä¶ so like working 4 years doing features for a game, at least 3 years are lost in things that should have been in the engine in the first place, and most of the time, no other productions wants to reuse those features because they don‚Äôt exactly fit their needs ( or they think they can do better, tons of engineer have too much ego ), so 3 years are just lost; and that‚Äôs how you accumulate techdebts

But don‚Äôt worry guys, headquarters said it‚Äôs because of the remote work, coming back to office *to answer teams calls and writing line of codes* will fix the situation for sure

I used to respect them and be proud that they had a studio in my backyard. I used to enjoy their games for the gameplay and spend hundreds of hours in worlds they created. 

Today‚Äôs Ubisoft is only a shell of its former self. 

From my personal experience I have found blatant misrepresentation of game mechanics and features, greedy micro transactions which assist you in getting past artificially inflated grindy game sections, a complete lack of attention when it comes to storytelling, character development and player experience, and dismissive behaviour towards customers and their biggest fans. 

It‚Äôs so unfortunate to see a studio that once made incredible games like Splinter Cell or Ghost Recon completely fall apart and become another EA or Activision. 

I played the technical test and beta for breakpoint and it was an absolute mess. There was barely any audio, animations and textures were completely missing, and it looked like a PS2 game. But the cash shop worked flawlessly. 

I bought Watch Dogs Legion with the promise of awesome features like being able to play as anyone, and then was shocked to discover bugs and technical issues that could have been squashed before release, game ending crashes, terrible controls, awful voice overs and basically the same handful of perks for every character. I asked for a refund after 30 minutes of play and was denied because I ‚Äúlaunched the game‚Äù. I had to get help from PayPal to get my money back for a broken mess of broken promises. 

It‚Äôs fair to say I will not be buying a Ubisoft game ever again. This company has lost my fandom, lost my interest, lost my trust and lost my loyalty. I am beyond disappointed that they refuse to see this and take efforts to coerce people into thinking differently while doing nothing about the reason people think this way about them. 

It‚Äôs a shame.",2024-09-26T19:47:54Z,0,0

The execs that left because of that movement would have left because either

1. They knew they engaged in sexual harassment or assault and needed to leave before they got caught
2. They were caught doing sexual harassment and assault

The interviewee wants to frame this as a bad thing by implying ‚Äúfixing sexual harassment/assault issues = boring games‚Äù. However, there is no causal link between the two. It is completely possible and normal to have a healthy workplace and still make good games. Nothing about holding people accountable for sexual harassment or assault would inherently affect game direction, unless the game direction was somehow literally moving towards sexual harassment and assault. I think it is extremely disingenuous for the interviewee to imply that fixing workplace culture makes bad games, and it‚Äôs honestly a huge red flag imo to distrust this person‚Äôs framing of the situation.",2024-09-26T19:18:48Z,0,1

You don't get Indians, Chinese being pushed into Western stories
 This is more a question of Racism, Disinterest and condescension of the white liberal towards black culture, history and people

It's saying we need to have black representation and if we bothered to look we could say do a Civil War AC, Boer War AC, with a Black protagonist, but as White liberals, we don't actually care or are interested in Real black history, but we need to virtue signal. 

So lets rinse and repeat black history month , and bring out the same tired old dead people , such as Mary Secole in the UK who was not a person of much note, but hey she's the one we picked 

So this is a perfect demostration of White liberal racism, so when they made Black Vikings, a Black Henry VIII, it's because these people have zero interest in African stories, caribbean stories, they do the bare mimimum , and say look are you happy , we allowed you (black people) into our stories.

Because we have European stories, Chinese stories, Indian Stories, none of these 'woke' companies do African stories

The user gejnormcswipe8435  said:

Wanted to add something I've not seen repeated elsewhere. In the Japanese-american youtuber Dashblue's video (found here: /watch?v=rxydfYaAwjw ) his wife who is fully Japanese points something out (actually a whole slew of things the woman has eagle eyes, maxed out perception): They are giving Yaskue both clothes and a sword riddled with Nobunaga's family crest.

The issue? You have to ask for permission to use that, as that family IS STILL AROUND TO THIS VERY DAY. 100% chance they just went and added it thinking its fine because historical revisionism is fun.

Oh they also added the crests to banners in the game but then fucked up the format so its stretched out and cut off on the banners. This is a legit insult and would've had a banner maker killed for his insolence back in those days.

So not only have they just most likely not asked for permission, their lazy approach to things where they cut corners have brought a great insult to the Nobunaga family. 

Not that they care of course, gotta shove the Message (tm) everywhere.

In that same video Yaskue is praying at a Buddhist shrine.

This Buddhist shrine is infamous for NOT being allowed to be depicted elsewhere, they NEVER give permission.

Ubisoft did it anyways, most likely just went ""COOL SHRINE"" and didn't even bother to check.",2024-09-26T19:12:33Z,0,0

Something I wanted to mention (I'm not sure if you still read these comments) is that, during Warframe's Whispers in the Walls quest, the entire thing is woven through the narrative of the relationship between Loid and Albrecht, and the only people I can find whinging about it in the comments are people that are so cartoonish about it that I can only assume they're trolls. Even watching you play it, at no point did it bother you, or at least you didn't show it.

The reason is because the game, and the quest, are really fuckin' good. Warframe doesn't have to put in a queer relationship to hide behind inclusivity brownie points, they did it because it made sense!! It fits in the narrative of the Entrati, the social dynamics and situations of the Orokin, the roles Albrecht and Loid had in their work. It was thought out and well done and passionately crafted to tell a story with good payoff.

I mean, shit, even years ago Warframe had a quest about an autistic kid that got rejected by the Tenno of the Zariman, **because** of his autism. And at no point did it feel like it was preaching a message - it was part of the story, and it mattered.

Warframe has never been a ""boy's club"", Warframe has never had to chase sex pests out of their executive suite. You know what, we can even toss in that Warframe is Woke as shit, due to their support of LGBT charities and vocal support of their queer staff.

The game is a fucking blast, so nobody cares about the woke. Hope you can use this as a talking point in a later video to explain the intellectual dishonesty on the topic.",2024-09-26T19:05:58Z,0,0

I did the most logical thing to do, something that needs to believe in life and bet on yourself. You just leave a company like that and rebound somewhere else.
Just look at ANAPURNA devs. That's how it should be. Good and great devs passionate about their job should probably think more about the real power they hold in their hands.

The activists only have their words for them. If they lose their jobs, they won't find a new one, because they are bad at what they do. I believe talented people will rebound anyway, and honnestly, I have this feeling that smart new studio heads will take the next few months realizing the great thing that is happening, big fat dinausors falling, a big pool of talented devs tired of the stupidity that creeped into some of the big western studios, and a void that will need some great filling materials, aka GREAT games.

Unfortunately we live in a crazy world. Do you remember when the customer was always right. Those days are gone. Just like Radio, TV, and the Internet this form of entertainment has been hijacked by hypocritical ideologues.  Isn‚Äôt the focus of a business on making money. This entire generation has been plagued with super woke agenda driven games that review around a 5.  The reason these games suffer is because they are made to re-educate you and not entertain you. If you agree with the video and my comments know that you are not the target audience. Imagine a 7 year old getting his first console. It‚Äôll be all they know. No Atari, no Intelavison, no 64. A clean slate to program. So it‚Äôs happening and it‚Äôs not going to stop. Not until the next trend hits. How much profits have these companies made? That they can blatantly slap its consumers in the face. And say screw you buy it. Look 2010 was a boom year in video games. Mass effect 2 um yummy. Anyway but at that point you have to realize games were made by gamers for gamers. White males for white males??? I‚Äôm not going there. I‚Äôm not saying that. I am saying the developers were growing with the tech in real time. So in 2007-2014 you had basically master degree or doctor status working on games. A maturity of growing with the process. It truly was a golden age of gaming. Gaming had arrived and delivered mature narrative‚Äôs that their aging fan base craved. Have you ever seen the level of maturity of one of these woke warriors? These woman child developers have no clue what the masses want. And they no longer care. What can I say social engineering at its finest. Expect an even more emotionally and physically weaker generation. All brought to you by angry women. Back in 2007 games in a lot of ways were chasing Hollywood. Not anymore. Gaming is a big business now. Which is another problem all together. But look at whose making these modern video games. And look at their world view. Vote with your wallet. Games only come down in price. So play your back log. Wait‚Äôem out the kids will make up the difference. It‚Äôs like the cable company everyday a gamer puts down his controller for one reason or another. And some dumb kid gets his first console as a present. And so on and so on.  I‚Äôll always have Syphon filter. What will these kids hold dear????",2024-09-26T18:52:19Z,0,1

They won't last 3 years, that's my prediction.



1:38  can I just say that it's not just this game, it's the other games as well especially Valhalla... I am a Norse Pagan and I follow the Norse Gods. 


That is my culture, that is my beliefs all the way to the point to where I study them extensively, and I know my history, and when I saw this game, I was actually quite excited for it started to play, and I kind of like the beginning, but they did so much that wasn't accurate, completely disrespected my culture, or they got everything completely wrong they followed some woke ideology and pushed an agenda that has nothing to do with my culture. 




From the shitty story to the horrible depiction of Vikings, too disrespecting my gods and all the way too adding a fucking tranny into my game ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

They literally added a transgender character in a nineth century to twelfth century timelineü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Keep in mind one of my gods do transform into opposite sexes and different kinds of animals to have sex, but every time he does it, there is a purpose behind it....

They made a mockery of everything I believe in, and the level of disrespect from this company was fucking beyond irritating ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨


They disrespected my culture, my beliefs, and they had the fucking balls in the gull to say that that it was historically accurateü§¨ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¨ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I could only imagine what people that are from Greece or from Rome, think about the entire situation, or what people think that are actually from the Middle East, think of the Mesopotamian Thing with Basimü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


For all their woke ideology and all the shit, they say about how them being open minded and how they're not racist they really are... They are by far the most racially motivated robotic motherfuckers that I have ever seen in a game incorporation. üòÇü§£




3:10  yeah, this is definitely one of those gaming companies that literally blamed the fans and gamers for for their problems üòÇ

They hypocrisy behind it, they create a giant shit case of a game they get blamed for making that shitty game, but then they start saying that it's the gamers fault ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


Bethesda has been doing this too. Recently they came out and said that we shouldn't be having high expectations for the upcoming Elder Scrolls 6... They say that their expectations are completely unrealistic and it's our fault if the game is wrong or bad. 

Funny thing is, games that live up to expectations are possible, and that coming from Bethesda, is extremely funny and hypocritical because they can create a game that leads up to expectations. Look at fallout, new Vegas that is the most popular fallout game, and it lived up to every expectation that was expected until this day, it is a masterpiece, people still play it till this day... 

Skyrim is another one that lived up to expectations and is still a popular game till this day... so these gaming companies, they have the ability to make wonderful games that everyone loves and lives up to expectations, but they are so lazy and they hate their fans that they will completely disregard what we say and blame us for their problems",2024-09-26T18:47:28Z,0,0

This phrase has been unironically repeated so often while I've been alive that I don't even remember if I've ever seen ""good publicity"". 

To me ""publicity"" is synonymous with bad. It's all just bad. The best things right now are things with NO publicity. This is why indie games are killing it right now. Because they're made by gamers for gamers with NO publicity. As soon as you get a hint of publicity, all of it is ruined by greedy corporations who have no clue what they're working on and who their audience is. 

Remember Rockstar? Up until RDR 2 (imo the best game I've ever played), their games came out with little to no publicity. Rockstar would publish a screenshot, or a 20 second teaser, or even just the Rockstar logo in the color scheme of the new release. RDR 2 had like an Arthur Morgan teaser... 20 seconds... they were too busy making the actual games to think of any commercials.

I don't agree with everything development teams do but the fake gaming justice warriors BS needs to stop these games are art created by someone else's imagination not meant to please all but those who see the beauty in their work. Y'all have brought this feminine energy into gaming with topics like historical accuracy and many other topics that are irrelevant being as though these games are figments of someones imagination. Is space marines2  , wukong , or final fantasy historically accurate. No they are imaginary stories. Y'all always find something to gripe about . Though you are free to feel what you feel that's cool but the toxic stuff y'all are doing is out of hand. Using your platforms to influence gamers to cancel games just because y'all don't like them is selfish and effects other gamers that don't have the same views. Some of us who have been gaming far beyond the time some of you were even born welcome a new type of experience and are more concerned with real life than gaming politics and view gaming as a pass time, a hobby , an escape. Y'all are ruining it completely. There is a flip side to every coin. The gaming community with these bs politics have gotten developers so nervous to work on new IPs that everyone is just working on remakes and remasters dating back to Atari . 
Most of the games topping this year off are proof of my point and next year will be the same. If you want to play a game you played 10 years ago go back to your old console and play it or play it on your computer. I personally don't want to live in what feels like a simulation or ground hogs day where it's the same thing over and over . If you do that's cool but do it at your own expense in your own home stop trying to effect everyone else with your own wants . Like every game should be made for you like $70 bought you shares in the companies. Play it or don't but stop trying to promote other people not playing these games. Influencers hate on a game still but it and make money off of their viewers watching them partake in the experience. If they felt so strongly they wouldn't even do a walkthrough or review of a game they claim to find repulsive yet all of them do . I find that to be quite hypocritical. How y'all going to influence others not to buy something but yet y'all buy it after the fact . Just for views and to try and find ways to cripple sales even more. Y'all did that with days gone ruined chances for a sequel to come out just like many other Great games not because they were bad but just because they aren't to your specific liking . I'm not trying to be mean but I hope the development companies go back to the ways of old and stop allowing y'all any access to any information pertaining to future releases other than a trailer , a release date trailer, a little game play and a demo and start copyright striking y'all for influencing the market , videos based on speculation, and opinions from people who actually have poor taste in the first place . I hope gaming gets super expensive so alot of the people encouraging this destructive behavior will leave and gaming can be gaming again instead of these nonsensical hive mind conversations from people that think because they built a PC they have a masters in game development and they don't know nothing other than what everyone sees online but not the least bit of trade school or college education nor hands on experience on the topic .  Why must y'all gossip, cry and complain about everything. In the 70s ,80s, and 90s those were categorized as feminine traits men either participated or didn't and kept going not trying to effect others but just participating in what suited them . Y'all different y'all try to change everything dispute other people to fit your own selfish wants rather than realizing that everything is not for you and let others enjoy what they like free from bland or any others critique or opinions. Stop trying to dictate what's available in the market that's exactly what the outcome of this crap is but some of u are to unwise to realize the outcome will not work in your favor and ruin millions of others  experience in the process all out of selfishness and greed over something you didn't create, own the rights to ,or no contribution to the making of in any aspect. Privilege in rare form. Stop ruining gaming we getting remastered 8bit Halloween games because of y'all old arcade games because of y'all instead of more innovation like stellar blade and wukong.

the game was clearly made by ""woke"" devs. now, i don't care about that, i think both the trans and drag queen characters were done fairly well (though i personally can't stand philosophytube), i don't care about there being black characters or gay characters or whatever because i'm normal. but other people who constantly complain about this stuff, why do you give BG3 a pass? because the characters are hot? is that really all that matters?

So while these people think they can have this utopian gaming market, that includes everyone apart from the majoriy demographic is beyond silly

The Western gaming market, which if it does'nt exist, you do not have the PS5 for instance, is mostly White, mostly Male, Mostly Straight.
Then if we look at the expertise of gaming development, in the west it follows the same path

So when Ubisoft and it's followers wish to exclude White men, they are saying we have no interest in remaining viable as a company

The Western Gaming market frankly can exclude DEI , the Woke, it will do very little to the bottom line, in fact would likely improve it

I think it goes without saying that I''m speaking to the non-retards here, that what I'm saying in the following comment is a broad thought, and does not encompass my thoughts on this video posted by Legendary Drops, nor do I claim that the entirety of this video focuses on, and does what I am talking about, in my comment. It simply was a single sentence that prompted me to think about the subject as a whole. So, before any Legendary Drops simps lose their minds... I don't know who Legendary Drops is, but don't worry... I like him. I subscribed. :)

I agree with all of this, but please, I can't help but cringe when I see just how fucking upset all of y'all are getting on behalf of the actual scorned culture here. And there are definitely many, *_many_* examples of... let's just say *_""A certain kind of culture""_* having a very peculiar habit of needing to get so fuckin' - and one might even refer to it as - *_faux_* anger built up and speaking for them.

What's wrong with you people?""_* ... it's at that point I want you to read what I'm saying here and not get triggered and just understand that your passion for the subject can that easily be taken another way. 

All I'm saying is... let's not forget that we're not the ones who need to be getting upset about half Torii gates. In fact, we literally fuckin' caused them. So, let's just chill the fuck out you guys, and let Ubisoft deal with their own shit pile, and ALLOW the Japanese to react as they see fit, and not speak for them. Kk?",2024-09-26T18:38:12Z,0,0

If they keep the status quo and keeping everything sunshine and daisies, the mediocrity will continue. As someone who‚Äôs been a die hard Ubisoft fanboy I was devastated after playing through AFOP and SWO. The games graphically are incredible, with some of the best looking worlds I‚Äôve ever seen. But pen to paper - risk vs. reward this company panders to the lowest common denominator and you can see that in every aspect of these now soulless, scared to offend anyone games releasing. I‚Äôm so worried AC shadows will flop because the RPG assassins creeds have been so good in the past.

I like how neutral and objective you approach this topic and other sensitive ones in the past, without constantly firing up the rage train. The problem for Ubisoft might indeed be the aftermath of this harassment affair couple years back. If you had such a toxic environment before, you hire people who literally breath a different kind of spirit. It's very likely that they also found their way into development. And if everything is falling under the terms diversity, safe spaces and awareness, it at some point has to overcome the barrier into the actual work. The ambiguity here is that games are usually mimicking a hostile, but fully fictional environment on purpose to create thrill, keep you occupied and let you escape reality. Removing or watering this down simply neutralizes the purpose of the game and the reason why you bought it. And that's why not only the Ubisoft games do not sell anymore since a couple of years, but also the ones from other big publishers because they sacrifice the product over politics.",2024-09-26T18:30:27Z,0,0

Rather than actually listening to the information given through responses/feedback/outcry etc., be it sometimes more erratic and aggressive, they completely deflect everything and stubbornly refuse to acknowledge any responsibility or issues.

One of the fundamental truths of design is that other perspectives are crucial to high quality and improvement. As a creative, you should CHERISH feedback/criticism. Feedback and other people's perspectives are what allows you to evolve, to thrive. It is the very essence of what allows creative spaces and industries to grow and evolve.

These people are doing the exact opposite. They are incompetent and ignorant. They continuously deploy logical fallacies or spew nonsense that has 0 logical cohesion, rather than reflecting and improving. They limit creative choices and modify every single bit necessary to fit their modern ideology. They are causing creative stagnation and ever more often creative decline. That is not how mature people act.

These people are an embarrassment.

DEI Ideology and snowflake-ism or whatever umbrella term you want to use compromises narrative integrity, authenticity, cohesion and overall quality and innovation of game design. It is something that comes after and isn't part of anything organically. It is coming up with a creative vision, a narrative and overall game features and then modifying them to fit this modern ideology.
It is not creative freedom as long as it's legal anymore. It is creative enslavement and restriction to conform to ideological acceptance. It is censorship to a very deep and disgusting degree.

The video games these company's make aren't creative endeavours anymore, they are commercial products intended to drive short-term profit and feed into their modern ideology conforming success metrics with complete neglect to any creative aspect of it or whether it is good or not.",2024-09-26T18:00:27Z,0,0

Ubi is never listening to what we really want, and instead they put update after update with a bunch of hot garbage that literally no one asked for and they said the community wanted, but never addressing the long list of actual tickets.

And I‚Äôm sorry you may not agree but meta critics reviewers scores were accurate. It‚Äôs a 7-7.5/10. A decent game but certainly not perfect. I played it and finished it and that‚Äôs an accurate assessment. If you got it for 1799 like I did on Ubisoft plus (which I canceled after the one month) it was even better. That said I‚Äôm hopeful they might be doing some changing.  And they need to take bigger swings and not be so safe. 
Also quoting anything from asmon is idiotic because all that guy does is complain about everything in nearly every video. He‚Äôs complained about the new dragonage despite never playing it despite the Youtubers, who have saying that it‚Äôs shaping up to possibly be a pretty good game. Nothing he says, has any validity to me anymore because all I hear him do is complain about things without ever touching them. You can say what you think it looks like, but you can‚Äôt flat out say a game sucks  for sure without ever playing it. I don‚Äôt care what anyone says.

They willingly handed the reigns over to lunatics, who screamed very loudly and assertively, and who kept waving their diplomas in ""comparative trans-studies"" or whatever and claimed to have all the answers. These are completely idiology-driven people, with a VERY cult-like mentality, who live (in their minds) in a world where everything is sunshine, rainbows, pride flags and constant validation of the most insane positions or for accomplishing the most basic tasks as a functioning human, while they are willing to send anybody to forced re-education camps (or worse) that they deem to be in the way of that. Their mindset is pitifully soft/weak AND murderously draconian/sadistic at the same time. These people positively revel at the prospect of having the power to punish and torture others, and to force others to listen to their crap. 

Worst of all is that this cult-like way of thinking has become so pervasive to us as a society, all kinds of media, and high-level business especially, that I fear that there is no coming back before a complete collapse. We stand on the brink of economic disaster because this mentality puts ideology over what is fiscally responsible or good practice.

Your explanation about ubi trying be safe is align with one of their biggest risk management which is ""toxicity in games."" They tried to make a game that did not offend anyone.

Some other thing i want to make note is how high their R&D cost which eat around 43% of their sales (if you the marketing budget, it goes thourgh 71% of their sales) which is very interesting since they only use the cheap junior engineer but their cost still so high.

Even studios that used to be all about the passion have become so big corporations. I had 1 lead before that was supervising my work - that used to be the one mentoring me, that build the studio. Within the last year before I left, I had 1 lead, 1 director, 1 senior director, and most of them are people who joined the company within the past year or past few months, being promoted up to 4 times in a year, while I have been there 7 years. My promotion was denied over and over because of ""attitude"" problem -- attitude that goes against the company view and ended me at HR more than once (that attitude problem was me complaining the game we are working on is not good enough and we should do more but  the answer I got was ""Meh, good enough""). Those new hires have no experience at all , and they aren't gamers, they come in and want to change everything we've been working on for the past year or so, and are so ego driven. It's sad. Luckily, I could retire. Look a bit around, lot of people who've been with big studios are leaving, so many veterans are just starting their own companies or retiring, this is a reason for that. By the end I was working 17-18h a day, 7/7. While other were promoted and cut everything down at 4pm every day. Barely doing anything, always that mentality ""It's good enough, nobody cares.""

That game has less issues then cod does these days and the disastrous bo6 beta a game they took 4 years to work on. Shooters always have net code issues bc most teams are overworked or publishers are lazy and working on that stuff isn‚Äôt flashy. Also xdefiant has got a lot of patches and updates since launch and they announced that the leak was fake and announced season 4 content already. It may never beat cod but for a new free to play shooter with shorter budget they did well imo.

At the end of the day, gameplay is king, and if they start making good games again, they will be successful no matter what, let's be real. Therefore, in the long term I think this might be a necesary lesson for Ubisoft to be learned, if we want to get rid of stuff like microtransactions, unpolished games, live service, free-to-play games, NFTs and season passes. Maybe after all, this whole ""cultural war drama"" non-sense might actually bring positive changes to Ubisoft. We are already seeing them trying to polish the game, add more side quests, offer the first expansion for free and getting rid of the season pass. I hope it comes to the point where they drop the live service formula and start to do complete and high quality single player games again as they used to. Even if I often criticize Ubisoft, that's because I love their IPs; I want them to improve, I don't want Ubisoft to fail, but just to do good games again.",2024-09-26T17:14:42Z,0,0

This might come as a shock, but Leonardo Da Vinci didn't actually build Bond gadgets for Ezio in real world history. Nor did he build fully functioning war machines (flying machines with explosive projectiles, manned tanks, war boats). 

This is called historical FICTION. That's why we can have Yasuke as a protagonist in Shadows. Ubisoft is doing what they've always done; taking characters we have little overall info on, and integrating them into AC lore. It doesn't matter if him being a samurai is debated or not.

There was a section of his game that a user complained about, claiming that it was simply there to pad out the length of the game to  keep gamers from demanding a steam refund.  Thor points out how absurd the argument behind the complaint is as he notes that the games entire run time, even with the section in question was still fairly short and would allow players more than enough time to process a steam refund.  But he also noted, that even though the player was making a demonstrably incorrect assumption in his complaint, there was validity to the complaint in that the section of the game in question wasn't good, didn't add to the overall experience and generally wasn't fun.  So, he removed that section o the game, replaced it with something else, and made the game better.

In these day and age, and particularly most big companies who have any sort of software development, regardless of it being games, products, whatever, this is the new reality now - This companies hire developers, they hire managers, and thus the problem begins, because while the company is growing, they only look at results, and unfortunately DEI happened, and everyone thought diversity would fix everything and make them gain millions and now, we're seeing the results of these twisted ways of working. Regarding managers, most of them is not even qualified for the job, which generates situations where even if you provide feedback for them that you don't believe the product is going the right way, they don't listen, whether it be because of their ego or because they're afraid of providing feedback for the upper layer. Regarding DEI, you got companies that hire people based on diversity quotas, which makes teams worse because most of the times they're just null, or you get people pushing agendas that have nothing to do with making something good. Allied to this, as you go up the ladder, you have people who care less and less  because by the end of the year they get their massive bonuses and if things go wrong they're probably set or will just move on as if nothing happened.

The reality is that today, you're forced to work in a fast paced environment where you're exploited to the bone, and where it's preferable to do things fast and shady, than to make things the correct way at first. Teams are mostly lead by people who lack the correct vision, and that think that what they design and they're ideas are final and are the best thing in the world, and when they receive feedback that things are not like that, they get surprised and blame the bottom layer. I know you like video games, so you can verify this for instance with WoW and D4, where you clearly see that player feedback doesn't match with the final products being delivered, and yet you had interviews from Ian for instance in shadowlands, where he said that they know how to design things and their vision was final, and that expansion was a debacle (the famous pull the cord). Next expansion he explained that most of the expansions are already in a pre development state, and that's why things take time to change, but still, you see that even today WoW and D4, even though they improved a few things, still keep insisting in the most of the stupid, petty, ignorant approaches to the game - I can think of why on earth on WoW raids you have to clear so much trash, and when you die you have to run like hell to get to the boss you died at... This are all little things, but if you export this to everything else, you can see how a company works, how leadership behaves, and why we get the products we get.",2024-09-26T16:54:23Z,0,0

Dude gets paid to write articles that are practically commercials/hit-pieces pretty often...


That article you talked about before isn't Ubisoft, that was Mark Rubin explaining the patch notes for the freshly-announced season 2 update.... the same update that provided us a roadmap to season 4 and the same week we got leaks for season 6...... invalidating the Tom Henderson article as a paid article (Activision is well-known for paying writers to write hit pieces on other competing games before release).

You can prove the game isn't dead by just playing it.... Last night on XDefiant doing my camo grind my matchmaking on a custom playlist got me into a game within 20 seconds.

18:55 You're being dishonest again... let's leave cod alone for now: COUNTERSTRIKE 2 DROPPED WITH TRASH NETCODE. COD IS INFAMOUS FOR PACKETLOSS.

I do have my issues with XD (Mark Rubin going to Ubisoft in the first place with the project, ugly models, Ubisoft forcing them to drop the game early, Ubisoft forcing them to use the Snowdrop engine instead of something normal like Unreal, listening to the idiots on twitter and nerfing the snipers with insane flinch while not at all addressing the broken aim assist abuse at the top levels in ranked), but you can't pretend XD's netcode issues are unique and another Ubisoft failure. Especially with the developers actively talking to players in discord/twitter and immediately applying said feedback to patches within a few days.",2024-09-26T16:52:25Z,0,1

Create new characters that just happen to be part of *minority or racial group* and make them fantastic. Do not change an established lore or real world history to satisfy some bull quota.

That he would be this big and muscular is downright retorded! Most Africans are skinny at best.
Yet they portray him as a giant buffed afro american dude who kicks Japanese arse for the fun of it. If that isn't racist in multiple directions, nothing is!
This guy could have been a huge questline, to get him out of Japan etc. But instead, he became the main character no one asked for. In a game where you should play as a Japanese Samurai everyone asked for over ten years ago already!

If anything he's a native African and has nothing to do with murica in the first place! The game plays at around 1579 (year). That's before any British colonization project what so ever. America wasn't even a wet fart in anyone's pants at that time! But sure, he's Afro American origin before murica was founded, with HipHop in his blood... 
My ffking god! There is only so much BS you can bend even in a video game or any phantasy story before people will ask if the creators of such a story/product are mentally ill and downright retorded!

And they even had to pander the release of the game to Feb. 2025 the black history month. Pandering racist POS woke company! They somehow managed to insult everyone, thats how insane they are! #CancelUbislop",2024-09-26T16:42:21Z,0,0

Especially to the degree of silence during critique sessions when designing something out of fear of ""hurting someone's feelings.""

Ubislops also use the Buddha (Nara Daibutsu) statue in their game,

You Need to have japan and culture ministers permission to use that statue commercially (because it's a Japan national treasure)
But most of the time they give only permission for educational purposes and they need to make it culturally and historical appropriate.

Do you know who is liable for these things? The companies that make the platforms that allow you to say things to females speaking out loud in a public lobby and being told to kill themselves and they're a whore, trans people being told they shouldn't exist, God forbid someone finds out you had an abortion with your partner. The right-wing snowflakes will start crying at the slightest bit of wokeness, Baldurs Gate 2, TLOU pt2, and Elden Ring, all games with left leaning features like a lack of gender specific options for character creation, you can be trans in BG3, won GOTY. ""Wokeness"" is not the reason why these games fail, it is about the lack of ingenuity and creativeness in the developer space. 

The games industry has been having a creativity rot for ages due to that shift of people who are racist, transphobic, or worse; being fired. Creative minds that should not have a platform for their agenda, believe it or not, having a sexy character does not mean a game is good. Fable 1-3 are amazing games and the characters look ""stale"" or ""normal."" Same with Elden Ring, women have realistic armour, sure the feet models are weirdly modeled but thats beside the point.

Corporate suppression of creativity, putting money over art and quality

The nature of the problem has changed though. The wokeness and ideology being in the games is annoying but in itself doesn‚Äôt destroy a game or it‚Äôs sales. Where it truly does the damage is by infecting the management and the entire dev team gets cleaned out of talent and innovation to replace it with sanitized cardboard. Once it reaches critical mass like it has now, they don‚Äôt even care about money and we lose even that leverage. When devs literally think they‚Äôre doing gods work and ‚Äúsaving lives‚Äù criticism is out of the question, social justice is too important and satisfying customers cannot get in the way of it.

I was amazed by AC Origins not just for the story and how amazing that game was and its dlcs. 
But its portrayal of Egyptians, phenotypically they looked Egyptian the protagonists and npc were not whitewashed or blackwashed as we see a lot in Western media, the lifestyle of the farmers shown in their side missions and npc scripts is accurate to the history and the Egyptian character as the farmer is the best representation of Egypt for 80% of Egyptians were farmers up until the industrial revolution, the class clashes between Egyptians and the Greeks and Romans perfectly captured the Egyptian spirit, they even portrayed the sarcasm in the face of hardship and oppression which is a common trait in Egyptian culture. Their portrayal of ancient Egypt and the Egyptian character was what we all want, Authentic.

Back then there were ACTUAL racist posts about Bayek's voice actor being black and they were all bs imo as Bayek is an Egyptian character, who cares what his voice actor looks like and Abubakr exceeded all expectations in his performance anyways, back then UBI was right to ignore these people, but ever since Odyssey the excessive DEI nonsense is enough reason for people to boycott Ubisoft like they've done.

I miss AC Origins Ubi, That is the Ubisoft I want, the Ubisoft that actually cares about their games' story, world, gameplay, and authenticity!",2024-09-26T16:08:08Z,9,114

They have reached a size of their audience that would make them go well even if they sell literal crap, it will always sell in the millions of copies, covering well over the cost of production of a few unexperienced junior developers, not enough experience to push out a decent game and definitely not invested in trying to make it better.

Most likely they dont know how to dissect criticism at all, which is a skill any well adjusted person has. 

What is the criticism?
Is it just insults?
What are their points?
Do those points have a basis in reality?
Can those points be acknowledged in a meaningful way that satisfies both criticizer and the one being criticized?
Do those changes have further impact on other areas related to it?
How can I minimize that impact?


Criticism is annoying. Nobody likes being told theyre wrong or should ""fix"" something, but that is life. You will be wrong at many points, and a mature person will roll with those punches and grow. An even more mature person will look for those criticisms in their life before anyone else can. Essentially being your own critic. Similar to a moral compass, but instead of being something you (Hopefully) inherently have, its a skill you have to work to develop. We can see the results of not developing that skill on display here, and Im sure we have all met someone before who has also not developed it.

There are so many different terms that we were conditioned to use growing up as our developmental slang and now it's not okay to use them anymore and we are actively told that things that we learned in our childhood and became ingrained in our mannerisms are bad. I wholeheartedly believe that these trends in human behaviors and judgementalism as a norm is really destroying our society and our entire race, leaving every generation at each others' throats and a collapse of unique identity for the individual, as well as an impending collapse in many sectors. The funniest part of all of this is that many of the people that are pushed to enforce these ridiculous and silly standards don't even really believe in them, themselves, but they are forced to uphold them out of fear of ""being cancelled.""",2024-09-26T15:58:30Z,0,0

I couldn't give the slightest crap about the precise importance of a black man in the shogun's army. I don't give the slightest crap about the historical accuracy of a building that has Chinese influence rather than Japanese.
I'm incredibly mildly concerned that Ubi stole the flag of some inconsequential Japanese re-enactment group.
I'm ever so slightly more concerned that an action figure that is not even IN the game looks like a gate that was left standing after the destruction of a city that was levelled for attacking a nation it was not even at war with.
All of this pathetic outrage about historical accuracy from people who never THOUGHT about history until this bandwagon started does nothing but make me want to buy it to spite them.

What I DO care about, is the fact Abusisoft's CEO Yves Guillemot, is a sex abuse apologist who ran interference for a senior manager at his company, allowing the man to remain after he harrasseda female staffer to such a degree that she commit suicide.

The rise of ugly girl bosses, trans fools, and lgbt folks are an assault against Masculinity and the family.

How do you weaken a society? Start with the Men.  You ever notice how much ""More"" coverage/praise ""Transitioning Men"" get vs. ""Transitioning women""? 

Then you attack them in their spaces, like games and movies and sports, see the sudden rise in ""Female"" sports announcers and refs? Weak men are saved by girl bosses in almost every movie now.

I grew up watching Arnold, Bruce W, Sly Stallone, Kurt Russell, Mel Gibson, Van Damme, Dolph lunderin, Carl weathers...ect.  Manly ass dudes who got shyt done in the movies. 

 Boys today have gay cartoons, and public tv.  Drag queens are reading to our young boys, and woke teachers are pushing lgbt freakiness in schools, they even put a tampon recepticle in the BOYS restroom at certain highschools. 

And the final leaf falls, now ""Everyone and Everything"" has to have some ""gayness"" to it, being gay is the OPPOSITE of Masculinity and strong Men. 

This is an attack on Man and the family God established in Genesis.

African Americans were not as prolific in fuedal Japan as Native Americans were in America (duh). The inconsistency in their depictions of fuedal Japan, their sudden lack of cross referencing their research, is the problem. There was a time when Ubisoft took such care with their research, the Notre Dame was rebuilt using AC: Unity's faithful recreation of the Notre Dame in the game (I think it was the Notre Dame, but the fact remains their game was used to fix a historical monument after severe fire damage).

Yes, there‚Äôs toxic gamers. Yes, there‚Äôs a push for diversity. But if gameplay is king, real gamers should be waiting to play the actual game before passing judgment. Further, Japanese community asking for better Japanese representation IS further wokeness. Diversity CAN be done well - gender fluidity in Elden Ring, for example, or Baldur‚Äôs Gate.
I dislike Ubisoft games for gameplay reasons. I think we, as gamers, should be completely open to experiments in representation. We should be both healthfully discerning and warmly welcoming of anyone who wants to work in this space in the name of welcoming others. We WANT more diverse gaming communities. We WANT ESPECIALLY more gamers, because that means more people to play with and more money for production. We need to end toxic positivity, but there are healthy ways to do ‚Äúwoke.‚Äù More, there are times when it doesn‚Äôt work, but the gameplay is still worthy.

Even considered ""This might be fun as a job."". Good thing I didn't follow with that thought. I always wonder how people end up signing up bad contracts as an employee with a gaming company and then going with all kinds of crap for years. Why? You gotta have more self-respect. And if it's not listed in your contract, then you should be allowed to call out bullshit. If not, gather up and sue them. But not even that is happening. I think unionizing would help a lot and should definitely happen all over. Are people stretched so thin due to life choices that they are forced to take the crap and try to keep their jobs, because if they lose that job, then they don't have any savings? That seems so absurd for a skill set that is required for an animator for example. I know if I got a promotion, I wouldn't immediately get a more spacious house etc. because I could afford it but barely save anything, that's not a good thing. Though there are people who have put themselves in that situation as well. Best thing is to look for another, better place to work and then just one day you don't arrive to that crappy ex-workplace anymore.

The answer has and always been ""use your head"". This is entirely a leadership issue. 

The people on the ground can be confused and not have an opinion. The leader MUST have an opinion. 

The leader should know if the game is a hit or a miss before its released. If he thought it should be a hit and it missed. There you go, the leader sucks and needs to be fired.

They haven't had a new idea in ages and their quality has been backsliding... It's frustrating, I remember playing Division and seeing glimpses of brilliance through the muck of the general experience. Watch Dogs was a fantastic franchise that got kneecapped by presentation, with the underwhelming Legion kinda sealing the deal. Siege was once a great game, it had the potential to become a tentpole of the genre. Skull and Bones could've been a smash hit with the live service model keeping the lights on for years if it weren't for everything wrong with it.

(Modded out) I‚Äôm not a fan of segregation or gender superiority, but history is fawking history, changing it, dumbing it down, or re-writing it isn‚Äôt making what happened better, if you want to educate people on history, make it accurate!

The gunplay and movement feel MUCH more akin to Call of Duty and frankly shockingly so as a guy who once loved CoD but fell off from all the non-sense in their games.  Last CoD game I enjoyed a lot was Black Ops 3 and last decent CoD IMHO was BO4.  But XDefiant for me does feel that same way when I look at the gameplay and how it plays and feels and really its been a refreshing thing personally.

Now netcode and other issues?  Makes sense but even then some of those issues seem to stem more from trying to use an engine not designed for FPS games, which can still check out what you are saying and heard but does have another thing often overlooked where you need to create systems and designs have to be built from the ground up to work first because the engine doesn't really suit it.  IIRC the Snowdrop engine (The engined used XDefiant) was more for MMOs than FPS games.  Maybe third person shooters at the most but that is still enough of a difference to make it so not everything will fit nicely.

Now again, not me trying to white knight Ubi here, just saying personal experience and many others but that doesn't seem quite right in the slightest when it comes to gunplay and similar feeling off.  And tons of others I think will say the same, even avid CoD players and YouTubers.

And no its not gonna be 1 for 1 the same, but I also wouldn't expect so when you use a different engine entirely from what CoD has been using tbh.

Just my two cents personally.  Love your work man and keep it up.",2024-09-26T15:45:33Z,0,0

And AC Shadows is no different, for Ubisoft eastern asians are all the same, lol its hilarious, especially considering the virtue signaling",2024-09-26T15:38:11Z,0,0

The issue is bad writing, not that a brown person is on your screen. But so many people conflate the two, and just yell out straight racism and others act like they're making a good point. We don't have to ping pong between the two extremes. I wish people would approach this as what it is, a lot of different people with different ideas doing different things, some works some doesn't. Instead people tend to treat things like monoliths, and you have to accept everything or nothing about the monolith. It's very frustrating. 

This channel hasn't gone down the racist path, which is why I'm still here. I'm just saying you're standing at a rode that leads to a certain place. And far too many people take that road too easily.

It's true that they're out there. It's true that if you try to include characters that fall outside their Overton window, they're going to scream about wokeness and DEI and everything else. Nothing is going to make that crowd happy, just like nothing is going to make the self righteous harpies on the other side happy. Being outraged is just about the only way to feel something in this day and age. 

The thing is, most gamers don't really care, so long as the game is good. BG3 is unabashedly queer from top to bottom, but first and foremost, it's a good game. A great game, even. Everything about its design, from top to bottom, was geared towards giving the players the freedom to experience the game however they wanted, and that resonated with basically everyone. On the other end of the spectrum, Elden Ring's Tarnished is barely a character. They're a tabula rasa upon which the player can imprint whatever they want, including nothing at all. And at the end of the day, no one seriously complained about the lack of diversity, because it's a good game. Helldivers brought an entire community together until Sony screwed it up by reveling in the hammy, dystopian vibes of Starship Troopers. No one cared that it was ""problematic"" because, say it with me now, it was a good game. 

That's all anyone can reasonably want or expect from developers. A good game doesn't have to match those first two in scope or scale. It can be big or small or single or multiplayer. You can pay once for everything or chuck in battle passes. The developer's philosophy on diversity or inclusiveness or whatever the hell else people rant about these days doesn't matter. Everything else is just window dressing. Honestly, I don't even think people would give a damn about DEI or SBI or whatever other three letter acronyms we're supposed to be mad about if they hadn't become shorthand for annoying and preachy.  If the end result is worth the asking price, people will pay it.",2024-09-26T15:25:00Z,0,0

Go to a country in Africa, put one or two of their best workers who wants to go there and make a game based on their culture.
Don't need to be a AAA game, smaller, indie, and so on.
Open a studio there, Dolar normally is bigger than a lot of the currencies in other countries, by half or the same price you may end with at least same level of quality and the ""diversity"" would be way more powerfull, because it's not just words, you will be helping these countries.
I'm brazilian, our minimum wage is about R$1400, dolar to real is 6x, so with 500 dolars, you would pay us 3000 reais, that's a good salary here, and I'm giving the idea, not for Brazil exactly, but there are a bunches of countries who could show their culture with this.
This, I'll put a black or women or etc here and that's it, is just useless shit.

The decline started immediately after the success of AC2 with cash-grab sequels, crunch, day-one DLC, MTX, fad-chasing, and all the other usual suspectes.  

I feel like this and other videos suffer from fundamental misattribution errors: you blame women, POC, and queer hires for ""ruining"" beloved franchises while being unaware of basic economics and politics. 

The really telling thing you said is, paraphrased as, ""when people are worried about their jobs whenever they speak up, creativity suffers."" The critical point you're missing is WHEN and WHO is doing the speaking. 

Translated, ""when the white guys are afraid for their jobs, it's all over."" Yeah, no shit. Bc they thought they were safe and only the women, POC, and queer folks were getting pushed out before. 

Here's a fact: financially successful companies don't hire women, POC, or queer employees except as a smokescreen. Often these people may be part of a company's foundation but they are quickly forced out when the company sees success. 

This is not to say that ""white guys ruin everything"" bc it doesn't come to that. Greed ruins everything and greed knows no boundaries.

Once a company is *already* circling the drain, they hire women, POC, and queer folks in a phenomenon called ""glass floor."" So-called ""diversity hires"" are attractive to investors late to the party bc private equity says they're good for growth. 

If the company isn't already terminal and diversity hires can put out the fires, they're forced out and the board of directors claims ""diversity saved the day."" If, as is more often the case, the company is too far gone, the fall is blamed on the diversity hire. Hence the term ""glass floor.""",2024-09-26T15:20:09Z,0,0

In ac they had Leonardo DaVinci making weapons for the assassins ,that didn't happen in history . but that's ok.  Now everybody mad cuz he's the main character in this game. Everybody full of crap.

And then take your talent somewhere else that is more appreciative of your points of view.

It's like a way to force compliance. Experienced and senior staff are more likely to push back on poor changes in direction, removing them and putting someone more junior in place looks good on a balance sheet as it usually means a saving in salary and someone following direction with more fresh energy as they're actively rising in their career. I've experienced this directly, the aim is to get someone who is 'on board' and if you have no idea what that role actually does, it might look like you succeeded on the surface, but the knowledge loss is real, you lost a lot of experience and knowledge of what got you to the dance when you binned that senior staffer.

So many company's bending to the minority of ""offended people"" rather than the far larger majority of their customer base just so they don't get any negative reviews ,, again by the minority. 
Ubisoft has been on this downward spiral for probably a decade or more ,, which as you have said is a management issue. 
Im guessing those making the big decisions are probably not gamers but the ones answerable to the share holders and board of directors and there fore have no real idea of what the player base want only what they ""Think"" the players want and what will make the most money.

- Admitting all the wrong / false stuff in the game (in terms of references to Japanese culture) and fixing them; also maybe removing some things that are considered tasteless by japanese people.
- Removing the stupid hip-hop music crap for Yasuke which, IMHO, isn't just an insult to Japanese culture, but also to black people (as if every black guy on this planet would be a hip-hop hood bro).
- Admitting that Yasuke probably wasn't actually a samurai in real life, and that they still wanted him as the main character, as a fictional, artistic interpretation of the events of that time.

That would still not have made everyone happy, not by a long shot... but it would at least have demonstrated an actual will to listed to criticism and show that their talk of respecting Japanese culture wasn't all just empty marketing talk.

I'm sure you guys are already aware that every single western media that focused on any part of Asia always had a huge fuck ups of mixing cultures up, misrepresenting, and some what racism. And to be fair Japanese media has done the same to other cultures. It's hard to get things right if you are from other cultures. I'm fine with ""Ok this shit's like 75% Japan at best"".

But then Ubisoft started responding. Now they fucking messed up with that hard. The treatment of copyrighted designs and the disrespecting way of (not) resolving that, still trying to sound like they did their homework, and trying to misrepresent Japanese audience.

The only way you are going to get their attention is financially.  The clowns at concord learned that the hard way. It is apparent that the developers need to continue to be taught a lesson about what gamers want/don't want. If you spend money and support crap products, they will continue to put out crap products and ignore the player base. Simply do not purchase the product. Eventually they go out of business or they make changes for the good of the industry. There is a large amount of excellent older games out there that you can play and ignore the new DEI crap that is being pushed....",2024-09-26T15:09:36Z,0,0

Massive Entertainment is a bit of a tricky one since it's been nearly five years since they did anything of note ‚Äî probably gut that too. Maybe keep the team that did the Prince of Persia Metroidvania because they actually made a good game at least, and keep Unfrozen around to do Heroes of Might and Magic for general goodwill. But generally, I don't understand why they need to invest in seven mobile games nobody cares about, along with five non-AC open-world games that basically play the same as each other. Ubisoft should focus on Just Dance, Tom Clancy, and Assassin's Creed for the most part. Just gut everything else. And yes, that also means Far Cry and Watch Dogs, that Toronto studio is botched and compromised with DEI like every other tech company in Toronto, and they haven't done anything of note for quite a long time.

This could cut down the company from 20,000 employees to likely 5000 or less, roughly the same size as Nintendo in Japan. You can't honestly tell me you need more employees than this when you look at the output of Nintendo. Instead of making 7 open world games, just pour it all into Assassin's Creed, similar to what Nintendo did with Zelda.",2024-09-26T15:08:38Z,0,0

Is it racist? Not all all, they are always friendly and very welcoming, but they take care of each other and a immigrant is still seen as a outsider here, it's very similar in other Asian countries like Malaysia, China, Indonesia, Thailand and more.
So the idea of Yasuke is very flawed in the first place and just looks very wrong to them.
A part from that you have to remember that many Asians suffer from inferior complex towards the west, they think that many of us are very beautiful and tall.

In a nutshell, whether or not someone went to college has become a MASSIVE factor in determining someone's political leanings. I grew up working class, but then went to college and ended up in the big corporate world, so I am one of few who has lived both sides of this divide. Asmongold says that woke people are brainwashed, and college, grad school and the world of large corporations and firms is where that brainwashing occurs. If you haven't lived in that world, it's hard for you to comprehend how pervasive ""the message"" is to these people. Most of these people are not religious - ""the message"" IS their religion. I don't think a lot of these devs are even capable of making a game that appeals to gamers across cultural divides. It is possible (see Baldur's Gate 3), but difficult, especially if the developers continue to believe that creating products that don't conform to ""the message"" is essentially evil (remember, the message is their religion).",2024-09-26T15:04:03Z,0,0

Besides that, you contradict yourself in multiple ways throughout the video, one being how one of the employees ‚Äúclaims‚Äù that they can‚Äôt have bold & daring ideas yet Shadows is literally getting bombed with hate because they took a risk using a historical character as protagonist.

As for one of employees *claiming* that Ubisoft doesn‚Äôt listen to their fans, and have this toxic positivity, how do you explain that a game like Watch_Dogs 2 was literally made after devs contacted gamers, used AmA‚Äôs and so on to make a game that gamers actually want.

 Watch Dogs 2 came out in 2016, understood, a more recent example is Assassin‚Äôs Creed Mirage, in no way a perfect game however it‚Äôs literally tailored for the players in terms of gameplay, from parkour, stealth and a shorter story. 

Even besides mirage, shadows is literally tailored to the gamers who‚Äôve been begging for a return to form with Naoe, focusing on stealth & parkour, while yasuke is for the action oriented gamers.

It‚Äôs hilarious how you claim Ubisoft think they‚Äôre on the ‚Äúrighteous‚Äù path when the statement they put out literally had Yves admit that they KNOW they‚Äôre not on the right path, and will try and improve their efficacy as well as management. 

Does the delay of their biggest game not tell you that they‚Äôre aware of their wrong-doings and want to release a polished product? 

There‚Äôs a lot of bullshit being spewed throughout this video that‚Äôs hiding behind bold words, I won‚Äôt deny Ubisoft is sinking, however these *supposed* employees contradict what Ubisoft is aiming for.",2024-09-26T15:02:33Z,0,0

""Differences between samurai and retainers"" copilot response. 
The terms ‚Äúsamurai‚Äù and ‚Äúretainer‚Äù are closely related but not identical. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of their differences:

Samurai
Role: Samurai were the military nobility and officer caste of medieval and early-modern Japan. They were skilled warriors who followed the code of Bushido, emphasizing honor, loyalty, and martial arts mastery1.
Status: Samurai held a higher social status and were often landowners or had significant influence in their domains1.
Duties: Their duties included serving their daimyo (feudal lords) in both military and administrative capacities1.
Retainer
Role: A retainer was a vassal who served a lord, often providing military services. In many cases, retainers were samurai, but not all retainers were of samurai rank2.
Status: Retainers could be of various social standings, including samurai, but their primary identity was tied to their service to a lord2.
Duties: Retainers were responsible for protecting their lords, managing estates, and performing various tasks as required by their position2.
In essence, while all samurai could be retainers, not all retainers were samurai. The term ‚Äúretainer‚Äù is more about the relationship and duty to a lord, whereas ‚Äúsamurai‚Äù refers to a specific class of warrior.",2024-09-26T15:00:32Z,0,0

Bruv, I am a Millennial too, and one with autism. I use that word on the daily and people can go suck a bulls left nut if they have a problem with it. 
If a black person can say nibba and autistic person can say retard. Same logic and they wouldn't yell at black people for saying it either so why yell at us for saying retard?

The idea of a foreigner integrating into a culture that is actively hostile to him and a woman who is performing a role that is male centric.

There's so many incredibly interesting subjects and ideas to bring to life in such a gorgeous game and they're choosing to throw it all into a fire in order to have a pissing match with the internet, the groups they're representing against their will and most importantly their customers which will fall into those categories.

Woke friends and family network cronyism is a big part of the problem with quality among other things. And this....

Doublethink

‚ÄúTo know and not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies, to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them, to use logic against logic, to repudiate morality while laying claim to it, to believe that democracy was impossible and that the Party was the guardian of democracy, to forget whatever it was necessary to forget, then to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed, and then promptly to forget it again: and above all, to apply the same process to the process itself -- that was the ultimate subtlety: consciously to induce unconsciousness, and then, once again, to become unconscious of the act of hypnosis you had just performed. Even to understand the word 'doublethink' involved the use of doublethink.‚Äù

""Doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them. The Party intellectual knows in which direction his memories must be altered; he therefore knows that he is playing tricks with reality; but by the exercise of doublethink he also satisfies himself that reality is not violated. The process has to be conscious, or it would not be carried out with sufficient precision, but it also has to be unconscious, or it would bring with it a feeling of falsity and hence of guilt. Doublethink lies at the very heart of Ingsoc, since the essential act of the Party is to use conscious deception while retaining the firmness of purpose that goes with complete honesty. To tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them, to forget any fact that has become inconvenient, and then, when it becomes necessary again, to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed, to deny the existence of objective reality and all the while to take account of the reality which one denies -- all this is indispensably necessary. Even in using the word doublethink it is necessary to exercise doublethink. For by using the word one admits that one is tampering with reality; by a fresh act of doublethink one erases this knowledge; and so on indefinitely, with the lie always one leap ahead of the truth. Ultimately it is by means of doublethink that the Party has been able -- and may, for all we know, continue to be able for thousands of years -- to arrest the course of history.""

‚ÄúWho controls the past,‚Äô ran the Party slogan, ‚Äòcontrols the future: who controls the present controls the past.‚Äô And yet the past, though of its nature alterable, never had been altered. Whatever was true now was true from everlasting to everlasting. It was quite simple. All that was needed was an unending series of victories over your own memory. ‚ÄòReality control‚Äô, they called it: in Newspeak, ‚Äòdoublethink‚Äô.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOceanic society rests ultimately on the belief that Big Brother is omnipotent and that the Party is infallible. But since in reality Big Brother is not omnipotent and the party is not infallible, there is need for an unwearying, moment-to-moment flexibility in the treatment of facts. The keyword here is BLACKWHITE. Like so many Newspeak words, this word has two mutually contradictory meanings. Applied to an opponent, it means the habit of impudently claiming that black is white, in contradiction of the plain facts. Applied to a Party member, it means a loyal willingness to say that black is white when Party discipline demands this. But it means also the ability to BELIEVE that black is white, and more, to KNOW that black is white, and to forget that one has ever believed the contrary.‚Äù 

"" ....that all written records agree with the orthodoxy of the moment is merely a mechanical act. But it is also necessary to remember that events happened in the desired manner. And if it is necessary to rearrange one's memories or to tamper with written records, then it is necessary to forget that one has done so. The trick of doing this can be learned like any other mental technique. It is learned by the majority of Party members, and certainly by all who are intelligent as well as orthodox. In Oldspeak it is called, quite frankly, 'reality control'. In Newspeak it is called doublethink, though doublethink comprises much else as well.""

This is Assassins Creed, it‚Äôs literal historical fantasy and it always has been from the very start. Most historical characters and settings in this series have been exaggerated. Why is it that all the sudden Assassins Creed Shadows has to become a 100% historically accurate documentary?

This is why I have to say, that although I have no doubt this game will be dog sht, but these anti-woke reactionary types are becoming the ‚ÄúSJW‚Äôs‚Äù that we used to make fun of years ago back in 2016. They‚Äôre becoming just as overly sensitive and hypocritical as them, at least.

It isn't so much about the love of black men, but a hatred of nationalistic male leadership. My example for this is Black Panther 2. As soon as they could, they removed all the men and suddenly it's a matriarchy, where women hold all the key positions of leadership and do all the fighting and make all the decisions.

Here they couldn't do that exactly since they needed at least one male character. They couldn't do a white character because they hate white men. So they fixated on Yasuke. Why? He exists to demoralize Japanese men. If this were a western world, they would have chosen a woman or a trans person to demoralize western men. Black men? Use a black woman. The pattern is pretty easy to spot when you understand that the goal isn't to elevate any particular race. The goal is to smash male systems so that they can be remade by women for women, and there is a bigger goal about destroying the society's ability to ever operate cohesively.",2024-09-26T14:39:33Z,0,0

I can't say this applies to everyone that worked there, but when I worked as a contractor for Ubi, there was certainly a noticeable progressive slant back in 2018.  I had my social views deliberately tested by coworkers once or twice.

As I walk into breakroom, a coworker I barely know holds up a picture on his phone:  ""Would you have s*x with this woman?""

Not the benign kind, where some girl wears a qipao to prom and gets lambasted on the internet. I'm talking the malicious kind, where there is very much a monetary incentive to not give a shit about the source of iconography because of some opaque, nebulous marketing department decisions.

Case in point, all the things that AC Shadows used carelessly, like the Sekigahara Teppou Tai flag (that they didn't get permission for), the half-broken torii gate (a symbol of rememberance of the consequences of nuclear armaments, which Ubisoft used completely removed from its original context), and Yasuke using the Nobunaga family crest (found through Dashblue's video here:  /watch?v=rxydfYaAwjw , where Dashblue himself is Japanese-American and has a full-Japanese wife, where they point out that there are still living members of the Nobunaga family that have a legal claim to that crest and need to be asked permission to actually use it).

I don't think people really have a problem with representation in games, not even those that the media lambasts as ""toxic gamers"".

1. Development needs: The game might need more time to develop. It's Bugisoft after all.

2. Feedback: The company might want to gather more player feedback before releasing the game. Ubisoft has received a lot of feedback and criticism. Personally, I received an email a couple of months ago and filled out a survey about whether I had pre-ordered the game and if not, why.

3. Community issues: The company might want to try to resolve community issues before releasing the game, which could lead to increased sales. There's been a lot of division among the AC fans (since 2017).

4. The most important reason is raising money. After the low review scores from fans and the terrible launches of big-budget games like Skull & Bones and Star Wars Outlaws, Ubi likely wants to raise money to help with development costs before releasing this game. This is why they are offering a free expansion now, and this is not because of the delay, but because their pre-orders are going poorly and the fans' reviews score are low.

In conclusion, Ubi is only delaying the inevitable after all the arrogance and ignorance they've shown to their customers in recent years. I have better things to do on Valentine's Day.",2024-09-26T14:30:30Z,10,17

I imagine it is like this:
The people at the very top of these companies likely have no clue and are just looking to satisfy shareholders. They are probably then advised by people in high positions and outsourced consultants who are ideologues who make decisions based on an ambition to make a greater cultural impact, first and foremost. Then you have the devs who either fall into one of two categories: those who share that ideological vision, and those who don't. Those who do happily tag along doing their part in ""making a difference"", while those who don't have to keep quiet and keep their heads down in order to not stand out among their co-workers ‚Äî while probably sharing a lot of the insightful criticism that would be necessary to voice.

Just my guess. Would be very typical in big companies like this even without the specific issue of ideological misguidance. Just the overall structure of these companies can lead to top-down tunnel vision.",2024-09-26T14:25:30Z,0,0
