This game is ok. Nothing special or great or genre-defining, but definitely not as bad as people make, and with a buddy, it can be  quite the blast. It‚Äôs like a poorly-written love letter to mascot platformers of the past, complete with many inconveniences of the past. The themed levels and designs are creative, and while some costumes are pretty lame (Fox Box IS the most usless power, memes aside), they‚Äôre generally pretty interesting to unlock. Storytelling without dialogue has always been interesting to me, so I found the cutscenes and learning about the people‚Äôs problems interesting to discover. The game‚Äôs real problems come in from curious one-button controls that make some costumes never used, a co-op mode tacked on in such a way that it seems it hates the 2nd player, and the balan bout system coming in to take away creative hiding places for statues in favor of QTEs that punish a player for not getting it perfect. Overall, I went in to see why everyone hated it and expected an unplayable shit storm everyone put on their worst lists, what i got was a janky and weird platformer that was actually kinda charming and entertaining in its own way. Moral of the story? Don‚Äôt just follow what everyone says. If it looks even slightly interesting to you, check it out, there‚Äôs places you can get it for cheaper (I got for $20, which is fine by me!)",2022-05-01T17:06:36Z,2,2

Balan saw a puzzle, gave it one obvious solution, then never touched that solution again. it‚Äôs the jigsaw puzzle of video games.

It has a deep and emotional story about trauma and the emotional burnout you can get from helping people through it. Also, it's so simple it can be told without any dialogue, and there's a dance party at the end of each stage. 
The core of the gameplay is collecting eighty different costumes with special abilities that let you explore new areas. The gameplay is also highly streamlined by only giving you one ability at a time, and jumping is an ability.

Balan Wonderworld is perfect for those who want a relatively relaxed game that delights the mind while not being overly tricky, fills up the cuteness meter, and rewards those who seek out every collectable. There are occasional frame rate drops and some potential confusion at the start due to lack of narration or knowledge about musicals. Along with what for some will be an issue with minimal lack of difficulty increase outside of boss battles and post-game content, this means overall enjoyment may be restricted for some players.

For example, a high platform that you can't jump to could be a lock and then the key is a double-jump power up or a wall-climb or a glide or limited flight or something. Functionally it's the same as just giving them a key and a lock but it's a lot more fun than that because the gamer feels like they did something cool to get it.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.

He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.

He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.

He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.

He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.

He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.

He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.

He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.

He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.

He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.

He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.

He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.

He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:

For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:

For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:

For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:

For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:

For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:

For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences

For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:

For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:

For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.

He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.

He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.

He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.

He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.

He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.

In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.

Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.

We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.",2021-05-02T05:55:13Z,0,0

Now that I've seen this video, as well as the one by SwitchUp, this looks like such a tragedy.  This game certainly has style, the design for Balan looks pretty cool, and the game concept should have been solid.  You can see with the musical numbers that a lot of effort went into making this game, which makes some of its failures even more baffling.  Why does the running animation look so stilted when they have fully animated dance routines?

It looks like someone modded his girlfriend away to the farmer. Wait those are the costumes as creatures? I can't take this seriously with a goofy dumb farmer like that, put someone interesting looking instead.
But I can see the gameplay is way too restrictive and controlled. My first hunch this was gonna be bad was the trailer when the worlds got put into place. Squares, blocks, flat plains and nothing on the sides or underneath. Have nobody there played Psychonauts?!
This entire thing is hard to watch. It's like a free platformer on itch dot io. It got the tricks and powers but they're very narrow minded to a single task with no idea of doing anything else. There's no polish or idea for broader game design.
They didn't even second draft the costumes! What does it do? Good enough!
Nobody sat down and said ""what if we can make it's ability do this as well?"" or ""how would this one interact with this earlier thing?""
Sad how these are interesting and fun designs. Just wish you could summon one as a companion to expand the puzzles more.

Even the whole costumes/hat thing is eerily close but done in a way that takes the fun out f it that could have made way for a lot of interesting design ideas with these costumes.

The idea sounds fun but in execution it just flounders. It's a cute story but....but you just need more than that for a game. They need to fix the issues with the costumes and how you can implement/use them, including the jump issue. I like the character designs but....yeah.....

Due to budget constraints, inexperienced developers, or poor working conditions, the project wasn‚Äôt turning out well. Rather than go back to the drawing board or abandon the project, they brought on Yuji Naka to try and salvage it. When the game still didn‚Äôt turn out good, they shipped it anyway in hopes of at least recouping some of the cost.

None of this is researched. I‚Äôm just speculating.",2021-04-14T18:10:32Z,0,0

Both are Square Enix distributed games made by legendary developers and were heavily hyped before being trashed by everyone.
And due to the recent bombs from Square Enix like Avengers and Outriders, as well as Left Alive and The Quiet Man, I won't be shocked if the next game they are making a Daikatana sequel directed by Randy Pitchford.
But at least Ion Storm (the developers of Daikatana) also made Anachronox (an RPG which I hear is decent), Deus Ex (a MASTAHPEECE), Deus Ex: Invisible War (a criminally underrated sequel), and Thief: Deadly Shadows (a good conclusion to the Thief trilogy). Balan Team or whatever only has this one game and nothing else.

Every one of us has sinned against God. We‚Äôve lied, we‚Äôve stolen, we‚Äôve sinned sexually, and we‚Äôve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.

The problem is, we can never ‚Äòoutweigh‚Äô our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake. 
Right before he died, he said ‚Äòit is finished‚Äô.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God‚Äôs judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..

Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response; 

Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward ( Romans 10:9 ). 

Do these things, and you will be saved.

If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn‚Äôt even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife. 

You‚Äôve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.

Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn‚Äôt guaranteed ... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 );

‚ÄòIt is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT‚Äô.",2021-04-14T01:41:04Z,0,1

I still like this game none the less, but I question what was behind the hindrance. I just felt like stuff was being rushed idk if its cause they pushed the ps5 out or what but some parts of this game has love and care put into and then other parts are neglected.  maybe it was too many ideas of where the game was going or just there was no general direction for this thing so it was like yeah go do what ever. I felt like someone gave up on this half way though but I feel like that most of squares stuff which is sad cause there is some genuinely good parts of this game like the art,music,story, and even so levels have part to it that aren't terrible.
I actually hope they make a second one and learn from the short comings of this since I actually want this to be a good game, just needs a stronger head on the directing department.",2021-04-13T22:16:34Z,0,0

Such a shame it turned out like this... I recall seeing really early production concepts, as far back as 2013~14.

Yuji Naka and co. wanted to make a spiritual successor to NiGHTS into Dreams. They got decently far into development, getting those really nice pre-rendered cutscenes and a lot of the protagonist/villain designs, but Square Enix midway through was like ""No. 3D Platformer now. We're not extending your deadline.""

I see the spark of potential in the designs of Balan and the protagonist children and several of the bosses, the stuff that would be designed first, but as we get more and more into the specifics, it reeks of executive meddling.",2021-04-13T21:12:06Z,0,0

Graphics are beautiful and colourful, dance sequences are charming, costumes are so much fun with a huge variety to collect. Balan Bout's are intuitive and rewarding when you complete them in a perfect run. The music is stunning. Balan is a fantastic design. And speaking of designs, the levels are just so much fun and they get better and better as you go. And the cutscenes... don't get me started!! Overall this is one of Naka's strongest projects and I'm so grateful for what he's done! And its probably one of the best 3D platformers of the modern age. Even better than Crash Bandicoot 4: Its Time. Thank you to Yuji Naka and his entire team for creating a WONDERful video game. üíóüíó",2021-04-13T17:23:05Z,5,8

This isn't a ""Strand-type platformer"" its actually a ""meta dementia simulator"".
Yuki made sonic, do you think he could regress so far after all these years of experience?
No, this is a game that is meant to show the affects of Dementia and Alzheimers. 
He knows gamers like us have played platformers all our lives. He knows we are getting older. He wants to show what getting older can be like. It can feel like regressing. Things that were easy and fun before in a game like double jumping, jumping over a fence, running faster than a snail that are basic moves in platformers are now ""powers"". Its to artistically express what getting older feels like, basic things like going up stairs are extremely difficult and require great effort.
Even the title is an expression of dementia. You forget the names of things, you forget the name of your grandkid. Instead of calling your grandkid ""Timmy"" you call them ""Jimmy"" cause your old and your brain doesn't work that well. Similarly, the game's real name is obviously ""Balan WonderLAND"" but its called ""Balan WonderWORLD"". This is genius level game development where even the title of the game is part of the holistic vision of showing us what the tragedy of aging feels like.",2021-04-13T16:40:26Z,0,0

They know little kids don‚Äôt care about high quality as long as it looks pretty and is easy to play. Alienating more mature gamers that appreciate the charm of games like this When they are actually good games to play like Mario or Banjo Kazooi. This is just lazy game development here.

Every one of us has sinned against God. We‚Äôve lied, we‚Äôve stolen, we‚Äôve sinned sexually, and we‚Äôve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.

The problem is, we can never ‚Äòoutweigh‚Äô our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake. 
Right before he died, he said ‚Äòit is finished‚Äô.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God‚Äôs judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..

Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response; 

Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward ( Romans 10:9 ). 

Do these things, and you will be saved.

If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn‚Äôt even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .

You‚Äôve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.

Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn‚Äôt guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 );

‚ÄòIt is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT‚Äô.",2021-04-13T00:49:59Z,0,1

-Square Enix
-From a retarded game nobody cares about except the truly fucking stupid
-Anime-like soundtrack of singing and shit
-Will fit in as both a brawler and zoner, because all we can ever add anymore is zoners
-Literally nobody is going to ask for him, but the SECOND he is added half of the fanbase is going to be all like: ""I always wanted this character"" while the other half (justifiably) gets pissed off
-Balan speaks Japanese (I think, since I couldn't understand a single word from him)
-*He has Blue Hair*
-White Hat like Cappy
-Guarantee for a really shitty stage like Gaur Plain
-Can have the main protagonist character appear in Taunts and FInal Smash while Balan continues to be over powered

Each power up is supposed to be related to the character who you are trying to save lifestyle and or turmoil. So you need those power-ups to get through the level, but if they has just focused on more energetic and simplistic gameplay it would have been a much better game. There isn't any reason to code an entire power-up that does one thing one time. They should have made a power-up that does multiple things at one time and keep to number of power-ups low. In addition to that, they should have had you interact with Balan more than just those quick time events. I see that they wanted to make a spiritual successor to NiGHTS, but this just isn't it. In NiGHTS if you weren't doing anything you were at least still moving and you felt like you had a sense of freedom. This just doesn't feel right at all.",2021-04-12T15:05:03Z,0,0

Why can't the dragon spit fire? Why are balan's qte's so shitty? Why does the a button control everything? Why is there a farmer that stares at the child main character sensually? And lastly, why the fuck is there a b-romance-movie slow run up scene to the farmer followed by a dance number? I'm so confused, that the confusion has physically taxed me, and I crave eternal sleep.
Edit: so I'm watching more, and would you believe it, another fucking run up scene with a fire fighter. So, theory: this game was made by a pedophile who wanted to create a game to display his fantasies of walking up to childeren slowly without looking weird. He also likes to dress childeren in random clothes and costumes, so he uses this game to do it. I mean, he clearly isn't a game designer.

""Balan Wonderworld will leave you with a sense of wonder. A nagging sort of wonder. The kind of wonder that makes you wonder. Wonder how a game could so masterfully miss literally every opportunity to treat its players with a modicum of respect. Wonder how a very well known publisher could stomach having it in their library. Wonder what in the world happened with the Switch version. Wonder where your $60 went.""",2021-04-11T23:11:48Z,0,0

All of us who were hoping for a rebirth of SEGA, who'd been waiting 14 years for a new NiGHTS game, I mean... seeing the trailer for this blew my mind. I had given up on any SEGA franchises, and was happy to replay the games I was given. But I had SO. MUCH. HOPE for this.
When the demo released, I was so excited. I played it on the Switch, and as soon as I opened it... I knew.
I was crushed. Everything about it was awful... but when the game released, I bought it anyway, because I still had a little bit of hope.
Now, I have to say, I think everyone is being a little harsh on the game. Most people judging it are Nintendo fans and don't even like SEGA franchises (even though this is the Balan Company, but I'm sure that won't live for long) so we're already off to a rough start. And most of them haven't even made it past the demo.
I beat the game and 100%'d it. After everything, I'll give it a 6.5/10. And that's because I LOVE NiGHTS, so I cannot bring myself to hate this game. But this game is riddled with flaws. Glaring, painful mistakes. It almost feels like a joke. One last pathetic slap to the face of Nintendo before completely dying off, as it is SO BLATANTLY a rip-off of Super Mario Odyssey.
NIGHTS didn't deserve this kind of treatment. It didn't deserve to have its legacy burn to the ground for some copycat dumpster fire.
If the Balan Company, by some twist of fate, survives... I hope they make the next game more like NiGHTS. I seriously can't even get into everything that is wrong about this game... but it is a crime. I still can't bring myself to hate it though, because I know I'll never see another NiGHTS game again... This is the closest I'll ever get. And that's a shame.",2021-04-11T22:45:41Z,1,1

Stop. Just stop right there.
While there are good elements, its oversaturated to the point that, even if they had more time, it would probably be a detraction rather than an addition. Its taking the kitchen sink approach to powers but the level design does not allow for any unique ways to utilize said powers, and most are either copy/paste or just flat out superior to others.

If this game had the additional time that people believe the game needs to be finished, it would go from a 4/10 to a 5/10...Not exactly a massive step up.",2021-04-11T22:31:12Z,0,1

If Squeenix wanted to make damn sure sequence breaks via clearing larger-than-expected gaps or climbing up/clipping through walls were impossible, they went much too far in the other direction.

This looks like what would happen if a developer decided to make the 3D version of a poorly-designed NES platformer that makes your character's weapons and abilities extremely weak to increase the difficulty. That dragon power up with the short-range flame projectile is Samus's pea shooter in the first Metroid without the long beam upgrade (yes, NES/Famicom Metroid actually makes you get an _upgrade_ to shoot beams across the screen). Balan Wonderworld's abilities are to Odyssey's what Kirby's Adventure's abilities are to their buffed equivalents in Kirby Super Star.
