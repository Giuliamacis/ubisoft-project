When it came out, i spent less in 4 hours in it.  Coming back to the game again 3 months ago, a whole lot better. Npc quests made the game more interesting. You can now respec at level 25. You can start off at level 20 with a good build. You now get legendary perks start at lvl 50. 6 total all the way to lvl 300. Lot more fun to solo. I spent 359 hours in the game so far.  The game is still not perfect. Still quest breaking bugs that you have to force to work by logging out. Still have enemies that still get stuck in posing. Not very frequent, though. Can still glitch through doors(which makes launching nukes go faster). Atom shop has better stuff but some questionable why should I buy this. The game has a season mode to unlock stuff, which can be good sometimes. Holotape missions should be taken out. Its confusing to start new character with having npc missions and holotape missions. I would raise the rating from a 3 to a 6. Just because it still has its buggy issues and game crashes.  Overall, though, i would recommend for people to play it or give it another chance.

Is Fallout 76 REALLY more bug-filled than previous Bethesda games? Or was Bethesda’s storytelling and style in previous fallout games enough to hide how buggy the games actually were?

Fallout 76 had none of that storytelling or style, and thus the glitches became far more apparent.",2024-06-18T17:53:20Z,0,1

However, now after the duration of time that's passed, I think it's safe to say for the most part this game's definitely in a much better state then it once was previously. Even with or without the current hype from the TV Series' recent airing, it's still been receiving constant updates and free major DLC expansions on a regular basis. 

Ergo, I pray Joe gives this another shot in the future, but granted it does suck for how long it's taken Bethesda...",2024-04-27T01:35:38Z,0,7

Since Fallout 4 is broken to shit on PS5 I thought I’d give it a shot and I’ve been decently surprised in about 5 hours of gameplay. No gamebreaking bugs, no crashes, no stuttering all at 4K 60FPS, and i actually enjoyed myself. Wether that’s because of the shows hype and me just wanting to get back into a fallout game, or because 76 has had substantial support since this horrible launch and my enjoyment is the product of that, I think it’s decent now!

It's been patches on top of patches on top of patches. The Creation Engine has to be one of the worst gaming building engines ever built.

i would have enjoyed it more if i could play it like 4 and vegas. i got tired of running everywhere to run errands and solve puzzles and mysteries and having to shoot my way on the way to each. so i used cheat codes, tgm and to run faster.  i got to see the story without getting so frustrated i wanted to quit. and i could go where i wanted 20 times faster. any faster you cant navigate in closed spaces. and i didnt die constantly needing to respond constantly which makes the game take so much longer, so much longer. oh so much longer.  if the game was made without shooting and just solving, it would be so much better.

The issues as they sit NOW in 76 is that once you blast through the story content, your left with the boring OG Halo tapes… and some of those can be done as dailies but who the hell would do that?

Going from a 3/10  with F76 to a 6/10 for Starfield does not bode well for the company. At least it is not a microtransaction ridden gotcha game like 76, but the company has shown it's loss of soul.

Then fast forward to present day with the knowledge of what Red Fall turned out to be... Another open world first person shooter style online live service style game that turned out to be 1 of the worst releases of the year... MAN... Arkane used to produce masterpieces. Prey is one of my favorite games of all time. Both Dishonored games are amazing. Death Loop was a bit underwhelming admittedly but not bad by any means. Still 100x more creative and unique compared to Red Fall.,2023-09-20T22:56:09Z,0,2

Does Bethesda deserve the backlash they get for this game and their complete mishandling of The Fallout license, yes.

Is Fallout 76 a decent game with a great community in 2023, yes.
I recently returned to this game and am having a blast with it. Its not Fallout New Vegas and what Bethesda has done to the Fallout lore is criminal. However if you want to craft a plasma rifle add some legendary mods and melt some super mutants. Build a Nuka Cola themed disco base and run around dressed as The Silver Shroud, then this game is your thing.

This game, specifically the community is the goofy side of Fallout. Strange illogical bases, bright colored power armor, and nonsensible costumes running around and killing automated werewolves together with super jumping mutations. It makes no sense and sounds dumb, but it kind of works. Shit Fallout 76 is Borderlands, I just realized that as typing this comment.",2023-08-09T16:07:49Z,0,0

But at it’s core the game isn’t good, so they really can’t fix that. But I will say they’ve done the best they could trying to. Hell, I’d even be willing to play it again if I could do so offline. Because I don’t play multiplayer games, so I would need to get Xbox live or ps now or w.e, just to play it. I’m not buying a subscription just to play a game that I already paid for. If I played alot of games online and already had online for those I wouldn’t care. As I’m not paying extra for it. But I don’t. So I’d have to buy an online subscription just to play a game solo. I hope they do eventually allow that, when they stop supporting it atleast. So it doesn’t become unplayable.",2023-07-09T20:18:15Z,4,3

They did not completely remake Skyrim. They ported the executable from 32 bit to 64 bit, and since video games have almost no 64 bit instructions it doesn't really help much. The only bonus was 64 bit addressing for RAM which is nice because now you can finally put things in the game world that they promised before but didnt because of memory limitations.
And the lie their Creation Engine was all new stuff and could do amazing things. 
Its just a patch on the Gamebryo engine and mostly it adds some lighting effects. It does not fix anything with the physics or rendering engine. 
And after watching loads of F76 vids its clear they did not create or add whole new technologies to make a completely new game. Its Fallout 4 with a bunch of tweaks.",2023-07-02T16:27:19Z,0,2

It was a petty battle that Bethesda picked with HH, having HH complete an alpha of the game, but waited on Bethesda to figure out what they wanted to cut and the next steps they wanted to take. The implication is that because Zenimax got the rights to Prey, they wanted to reboot it, but first wanted to make HH look like the bad guy and have them give up on the Prey 2 project. Eventually they did. 

What's more upsetting is, Prey 2 could have been a fucking all time classic, but after it's cancelation, we got HH to make Brink, Defiance, and eventually The Quiet Man. 🤢 They made gold with Prey, had an all time classic get canceled, and than go on a ridiculously bad streak of bad games before changing the company's name.

Would be cool if for one faction you turn the valve and water comes out, but another faction doesnt want water so it asks you to turn off the water, and then maybe another faction to turn a valve and there is radioactive water, so it would be a revolving chain of quests that all interact with each other and cause faction engagement.",2023-05-27T18:01:33Z,0,2

This way,after about a month or two,you'll have a server with amazing player made towns and settlements, so not only the game will grow as the players grow(because it's a live world and it changes for the better everyday!) ,but the players will finally have a reason to search for scrap and build something! imagine trying to build the best settlement of the game, so other players actually want to live in your settlements instead of other towns, or building it themselves.. not everyone wants to build stuff... 
imagine going back to some small settlement, only to find it growing into a large prosperous town with real guards and merchants! you would never get tired of the map! it's constantly changing! imagine renting a vertibird from a settlement,to another ally settlement, instead of walking for an hour! imagine trading with other settlements! instead of finding every item for yourself!",2022-07-31T18:16:10Z,0,0

Fallout just isn't a multiplayer game. Even fallout 3,4, NV, none of them were mainly combat based. Sure, they that element. But that is not the point. If I wanted to shoot stuff, I would play a shooting game. So, when you take a story game and make it online and add P2W features and remove a good story. You are left with nothing. The F76 story is almost worst than dog shit. At least dog shit has a value, somewhere in farming or something idk (Research?). So you have no reason to play it. UNLESS, you add end game, big boss fights, rare drops, stuff that will make you want to play with friends. My friends don't wanna run around for 5 hours listening to audio logs. The new ""npcs"" they added are lifeless and boring. They tried to fix it but it was too late. This game had so much potential. It makes me sad. It's like they have the tools, but just don't care.

i havent pre ordered a game in a long long time because i realised that it just incentivises devs to focus on promotional material which will always lead to broken promises and rushed deadlines.

and this problem is just the same if instead of preordering people buy a hard copy on day 1 at midnight. i mean honestly you're just giving your money based on faith that the game will be good, wait a couple days maybe even a week or two to see if the game is actually any good and then buy it. this will make games like this be financially unviable.",2021-12-30T10:33:55Z,0,0

There are NPC'S now but they are SO SO.
A lot of the issues that are covered here are still present in the game. They have added much more to the ATOM shop. 
You kind of feel pressured into FALLOUT 1st for the damn infinite scrap container because you can fill up way to fast and not have room its very much insane. There are much more negatives to this. 
Legendary perks are grindy and so if you want to change it costs  you all that progress. However you don't looks the progress on the card you change out it still costs you like 300 perk coins to rank another legendary perk card up which will take some time. Also much of them are useless and the worst part is about it they feel lack luster outside a few card that you will always want to have on. 

If you want something to just mess around in go for it if its on SALE. Other than that just pass this one up.",2021-07-26T03:42:39Z,0,2

I'm just going to say this. If a company is willing to sell you a product that breaks regularly, and is boring or useless when it isn't broken, and is also willing to lie to millions about the game, that is not an ethical company and does not deserve your money. That's not even getting into the shady and criminal things they've done like falsifying reviews on other products, removing negative reviews, selling products that aren't what the consumer was told they were buying, inconsistent refund policies and falsely slapping discounts on items that have outrageous prices while ""discounted"" (falsely claiming something that is any% cheaper when it's released at the discounted price is illegal). Bethesda does not deserve your money, they've proved they will lie to you, scamming and cheating you. Don't fall for it",2021-03-28T03:41:28Z,0,1

It's like they were trying to copy Far Cry's mountain landscape with the look of the game and while it looks decent, it's not great. A major let down is the whole purpose of the game and it become obvious early on that there isn't much of a story. The game was supposed to be about rebuilding but anything you do in the game has zero effect. How can one rebuild when nothing stays built? It's supposed to be about wanting to co-op but there is little to no motivation to do so. Fallout 4 is a more fun and an all around better game...",2021-02-12T19:08:55Z,0,0

If you didn't see FO76 coming a mile away though, you haven't been paying attention.  This IS Godd Howard.  Ever since he became the resident deity of Bethesda, his influence has been ruining their RPGs.  He has not a single RPG bone in his body.  Every new iteration of TES and now FO has been progressively worse in that regard.  And as Bethesda's fame grows, so have their attempts to overcharge their customers.  Now with added microtransactions!  It's ridiculously sickening to see the likes of the genius behind Daggerfall having fallen to the level of FO76.  Bethesda has always had bugs.  Has always bitten off more than they can chew.  But the innovation and depth and lore have always made up for it ... or at least used to.  But ever new RPG is that much less, while the old problems still remain.  And every new RPG has grown that much lazier and boring, polished to cater to ""Mommy!  Can I have this?""  It's sickening.  I *hope* that FO76 was their much needed wake-up call, where Bethesda as a company learns to tell Howard the Duck to shove it and do what people love them for.  But I doubt it.  We'll see.  I will certainly NOT be pre-ordering ANY TES or FO game from Bethesda ever again.  I need time to scope their $#17 out and decide if it's even worth paying them for.  It's a sorry state to be in for Bethesda, but they did it to themselves.  I can't even JUST blame Coddpiece Howard because at some point someone should have stood up to him and told him to put his endless dick waving to an end and gone back to making games the Bethesda way.  The best thing that Bethesda could ever to for themselves as a company is take Todd Coward out of control of any and all RPGs.  Let him focus on action games and shooters.  It's all he is capable of.",2021-01-16T18:29:19Z,1,7

I paid full price and bought it for survival mode. It needed a few things to be fixed but it was better than nothing. Now that its gone the game has zero value to me. I even asked for my money back. I was like ""since you removed a feature I paid for, I would like my money back"" They told me to kick rocks. Could you image a dealership selling you a car with leather seats then they come back a few months later and give you cloth. I never had to deal with a buying experience where I paid for something and it was removed later. Thanks internet based games I guess.

Most of all I hate the Fallout community. They are the biggest snowflakes on the planet. I think this game had good potential for some replay value with survival mode. But the community whined about others players killing them so bad the PVP was striped form the game. They wanted it to be another Fallout game So bad, that's what it become. But it has no story or NPCS. This is because was never intended to be just another fallout game. it was made to have players being all the action and a PVP war zone. This is where the game had potential. If you remove the PVP. guess what? No action. You just have another Fallout Game your playing by yourself with no quest or npcs. But that's what the community wanted and that's what it became. A big empty war zone where you cant war zone anyone because the snowflakes want to smash robots with out being attacked. Go figure a post apocalyptic setting with raiders and monsters that can kill you any moment... but GOD FOR BID A REAL PLAYER KILLS YOU WAAAA!. Thats the fallout community in a nut shell.

And with an rpg like this where you put hours upon hours into, one stupid mistake which is the game developers fault for not explaining, will make you want to load, but not being able to undo those little mistakes make me not want to play the game.",2020-09-10T20:57:48Z,0,0

Soon as I saw online only. I knew it was a fail. Fallout is not an online game. People are not npcs. Everyone lone wolfs the game. I mean literally. I like having companions cause they are npc and reliable. People are people. That says a lot. Fun with friends. Anything with friends is fun period. A huge copout. So time went by and I actually forgot about this game. I  accidently came across this. I am licking my fingertips this is so good. It's crazy how people flip out cause they are fanboys. Defending their Bethesda game. Denial much?  I am a fanboy and this I knew would be shit. Then its shit. Then people denial. Bethesda it's not shit this is chocolate cake. Eat your cake. None of my friends. None of my family members bought this game. Even over a year plus later we still don't have it. This was easy to see as a cash grab. Then they wanna pretend it's not about the money that their name and their games alone sells. I am enjoying licking my fingers. Oh the I told you so flavor. This is so good.

Area of the game is a miracle on it's own, mostly untouched by all nuclear bombings, basically almost a paradise. SO WHY WON'T WE FIND SOME NUKE CODES AND LAUNCH SOME FUCKING NUKES ON IT TO GET SOME LOOT!!!
Also, how in the fuck loot generates there after explosion? Wouldn't it be better if every once and a while, one of bunkers to launch nukes would lag, and there was a timer in like 6-9 hours until nuke gets launched, so players get locations where code would spawn that is needed to cancel the launch, and when someone gets it, they have to get to the bunker before it gets too late, and abort the launch? And when any player does that, player aborted the launch gets some good loot from bunker, as he can use the code to open the armory/vault/etc. All other players present get some small rewards, based on what they done to prevent it: (Was looking for code/found code/ entered the bunker, but it was aborted when he was in). Yes, it would be random as fuck, but it would be more plot based rather than launching those nukes on basically healthy spot on earth.",2020-06-28T10:01:19Z,1,0

And skyrim. those games look like shit compared to Oblivion and FO76. I was initially repulsed by the idea of Appalachia. But then when I saw the actual ingame landscape i was like: ""Damn. This is beautiful."" ""Even the god rays sticking out from those gray rocks are beautiful. Unsightly, and strange, but beautiful.""

The way it is right now, I'd give it a 6/10. Most of it is landscape beauty, the fact that they brought back raiders and npcs and npc factions, balanced pvp to workshop. I believe bethesda's fuck up was promising too much, and not having the funds to pull all of it off at once. And it's true, fallout 76 is a massive game for it's time. They over expended itself. It's much better but I don't like that it was only this polished after 2 years of so much issues. But that's my verdict as of June 19, 2020. It's a 6/10. I'm continuing to play because I really enjoy the game, despite it's problems. I'm relieved to say that half of the problem sint his video were indeed fixed. I've rarely seen a T-pose (all games have that glitch, happens when a character animation gets a script movement error and it reverts to ""default T pose""). Onyl problem is 1 quest so far is bugged. (Chloe refuses to accept the brahmin meat she asked for, so Io just dropped spoiled meat at her toes and left). And yes, enemies getting stuck is not unusual, but its thankfully not the majority of battles. I think it's when enemies spawn inside each other. I believe they should have spawn openings like in Borderlands 2 where raiders come out of their Tent flaps. If not, then just widen the spawn areas. If they could have a program that actively checks for bad npc spawns that would be great. I wish I could help them out but I'm no software/game developing engineer.",2020-06-19T15:56:26Z,0,0

The point is that they are simply bullet sponges that distract you from the actual treasure. You gotta shoot the cargobot thrusters, or destroy it's cargo hold arms so it drops the cargo, and you can pick up nuclear codes among other things.

They moved it higher but it's still coming from freaking gray rocks. I understand why though: Those rays can cause performance issues. So, in order to hit more people with LESS rays, they have ot LOWER it to our level. But that begs the question of: ""Well why not have the ray follow you based on the location of the  sun itself?""

answer is simple: Not everyone have two 2080 ti's and itll look like even more shit if you dont have ray tracing technology. 

I like this game, and Im willing to play through the bugs so I can help improve it. It has so much potential and I get it, its expensive as hell to make these games. But It just feels SOOO rushed. Its sad because I can see they tried but the technology is just not there.

The updates fixed all these problems and the game does look beautiful cause it is X enhanced. He should do another review. I did everything in 3 and New Vegas and I wanted more of a survival aspect in future games like Hardcore Mode in Fallout New Vegas. This game did that. Amazing quests, like even minor quests blew me away. Like how a woman worked for a greedy mining company that had mob ties and her personality and brain was scanned into a mainframe computer. Then she was killed by the boss she was sleeping with cause he was drunk and she threatened to expose him. Your quest is to reboot the mainframe and fix the corrupted parts to set her mind free again. I clapped at the end of that. The community is the best I've seen in a game, very helpful.

I got the delux pre order that came with the helmet and I felt really betrayed by Bethesda. Fallout 4 is one of my favorite games of all time and so I was super exited when 76 was announced. The world just didn't feel like a fallout game before wastelanders. I've now had about 20 hours playing wastelanders also on Xbox, and I have completed the main plot and some of the ally quests. Once wastelanders came out it felt like a whole new product. Lots of the locations were the same but it just felt so much more filled out and lifelike. The alloys (companions) are a bit of a disappointment, most of their quests are just, go here get this, or go there kill that. Also, some really well written and well voice acted moments are ruined by the bad animations as the gravity of things is lost when the npc's are limited to so few movement patterns. My final critique would be that you cant explore more than one option in a situation. I get that Bethesda wants to make players have to choose and stick with their choice but still, one of my favorite aspects of previous fallout games was the ability to quicksave before an important conversation and see what options I could explore. Too many times in wastelanders I wanted to say one this to see what would happen but didn't as I was worried it would damage my faction reputation of rewards later on. As an extension of this I would like the ability to try and kill every npc at crater or foundation. I thought that it was great in previous fallout games that you could just raid a whole town like diamond city just to see if you could. Yet, in wastelanders I cant do that because that might end my ability to associate with that faction. The grind to gain that status is so long that I don't want to risk losing that. Plus there's no real reward for just going on a murder spree (admittingly there isn't in previous fallout games either) so the game just kinda forces you to play by Bethesda rules when previous fallout games felt so good because you could make your own rules in your own world and cater the experience for what you desire. Wastelanders was a step in the right direction for fallout 76 and I am very excited to see what Bethesda bring out next (hopefully a price reduction on fallout 1st along with more new content). By no means is this game now perfect, there are still bugs and it is very much still fallout 76, but it is more on par with just a bad dlc then a burning fire of ""microtransactions, the game"". My pre wastelanders rating of the game would be a 3/10 and post watelanders 7.5/10. Both of those are not compared to all other rpgs but as far as fallout games go 76 may yet grow into one of the best!",2020-04-21T19:52:42Z,1,6

My friend was entirely against the idea of fallout 76 and especially after Elderscrolls online, I defended the idea and held onto the fact that at the time when fallout 4 had just released that Bethesda would finally work on the rights for the online game that they won from the original creators. Imagine me and so many people who waited years for that game to be a reality only to be founded with a broken half baked game that had more than enough time to become a great and more complete game but instead wasted all of its potential. I borrowed the game, my friend returned it after a week. This game had enough time to be more and it didnt, no can defend Bethesda. If they mess up the next soon and it isnt at least as good as the original dooms cause I hold their doom above those then I'll take my business elsewhere cause I'll have no trust with them anymore. 1 game that was ruined that had deep seed, I'll give them one chance and I'm holding the bar low for them this time.",2020-03-09T13:41:02Z,0,0

""Fallout 76"" does not have a single map with all the players in it simultaniously, epic fail. It does not have text message option, unforgivable. It lets you make alts, but all your alts have just your player name showing to other players (not their actual name), epic fail. etc etc. An over ten years old post-apocalypse MMO ""Fallen Earth"" had all  I mentioned done proper, but not Bethesda. I personally feel God Howard purposefully botched the game (for TES-MMO´s  favor), no-one could do that bad MMO just by error, it has all possible mistakes.

Well not usually, but one time I actually found a guy in Fallout 76 who was pretending to be an NPC. It was actually pretty funny. The way he was talking sounded like a game show host or something. I don’t remember exactly what he said, but I think he was trying to help other players find Nuke Codes, as if he was guiding them on a quest... Don’t know why he wouldn’t just give em the codes, since he knows where they’re found, so he most likely already has them. But I guess that would ruin the journey if he just handed them out, and that wouldn’t be fun now would it?... Anyway, every time you ask him a question or say anything to him, he just keeps repeating the same dialogue. Saying things like “No time to talk, we’ve got codes to find!” and “Follow me and I’ll show you the way!” exactly how an NPC would say it. I couldn’t help but laugh knowing that this was an actual person behind a mic, yet he actually sounded almost legitimately like an artificial or NPC. Not to mention because there was no push-to-talk and he had an open mic, literally everybody in the game could hear him yapping. I can only imagine how confused or annoyed other players were, especially ones who weren’t even following him in the first place. Which in my opinion just made it even funnier!

What's like every other game that you review you didn't play it long enough to give it a chance. I mean when you spend your time walking around looking for God raised or looking for walls you can glitch into because the collision detection isn't perfect obviously you're not going to enjoy a game but if you actually wandered around a map and explored all the areas that don't even show up on the map farms in buildings and things that you can find and that you can read the books in the stories in there to see what happened to the people.

They are worried about the stock price dropping lower as well as losing more  clueless people who dont know that Fallout 76 is a half finished broken peice of shit. The once loyal fans are filled with the fire of unstoppable rage. The current owner of the company should be fired and hope his replacement ( if possible ) can fix this nightmare.   How could this guy not know what his company was doing ? He had to know something. I agree with Angry Joe 100 percent. I only wish this game was done right the first time so more people could enjoy it. The wastelanders update I heard is delayed. Bethesda I hope you get fucked by a horny Male death claw on 2 bottles of viagra.  That way you will know how it feels to be stuck with something u dont want that you know u can't get rid of.

Bethesda 100% was leasing the IP back to obsidian, but halfway maybe a quarter way through development they took it back. But bethesda still wanted a fallout game to show off so they threw one together out of what they had. Meanwhile obsidian said ""we'll get our own fallout! With blackjack! And hookers! In SPACE!""
The outer worlds is a fallout game with a new skin (not a complaint that game is fucking phenomenal and had me crying just an hour and a half in)

They get their money because fans put their trust in these organisations after seeing flashy trailers of slick graphics and gameplay promises. They dont have to finish the game or meet any consumer expectations because at this point there are none. EA, Activision, Ubisoft are the same, too. At their core they are businesses seeking profit. If you give them money without needing to prove their product good then you allow this to continue because they sure as hell won't stop if you fund and tolerate it. In their world they are winning. Massive sales, big profits, no need to produce quality games that require hard work and planning. Why the hell would they stop? enterprises do not act on principle, they act on the most profit they can make with the least quality they can get away with. 

They wouldn't release a movie paid in advance because people wouldn't pay to see it until after the reviews confirming whether its worth seeing were out.

Reasons to not pre order:

-if the company refuses to allow pre-release reviews
-if they promise more than is feasible to expect them capable of delivering 
-if there is any mention of microtransactions being part of the core gameplay mechanics. 
- if the game studio has ties to a parent company known for putting quantity above quality eg Ubisoft and Activision- yearly releases are almost always going to be flops.

If you trust these companies and cannot wait till a few weeks after release for the reviews to come in before you part with your hard earnt cash, you only have yourself to blame. You are killing the gaming industry.",2020-01-02T22:27:29Z,4,128

Me and him have really different taste in video games. But Fallout was a staple series we both loved. When we heard 76 was online multiplayer we both looked at it as a sign that we can finally play a video game together.

Here's the thing, I bought red dead 2, 60 dollars for it, had a map, Gta 5 I paid 35 dollars for it (very late to get it) and that had a map..... 76 power armor expansion, if you paid 200 dollars you got

A map..... Toy soldiers.... A book (perk book?) nylon bag that isn't canvas (which with how they did that, they false advertised to those that paid, illegal in 90 percent of the planet, and can sue, go ahead, it'll get todds attention fastest)... And a helmet that by the health organization had to faking recall every helmet sent out..... For 200 dollars, and now Todd has made it so if you want unlimited storage, and a private server, atoms and a outfit, you have to pay the cheap option of 100 dollars a year, because 13.99 a month is around 150 a year, and still hasn't fixed much to the game, I waited on giving my money for 76 because when I saw the ads that filled tv and YouTube commercials, I didn't see a game that would be cool by design, I seen a disaster worse than when mankind created the first atomic bomb in ww2..... I told my brother this game wouldn't even last half a month before it tanked, and in two weeks the price from 79.99 for the game alone, became 39.99 then 25.99, I'm surprised they haven't made it 15 or even 5 dollars, EVOLVE, a game that I paid 5.99 for, long after the creators, 2k, closed it down, I bought evolve because I liked the idea of the game, and I still enjoy it, and I paid 5 dollars..... For evolve the game that is dead and possibly never coming back.... But hey in another year or 2 I'll buy 76 for 5 dollars and place it next to evolve just so 76 has a friend, UNLESS!!! Unless..... Unless Todd stops treating us like ghouls or scorched, and treated us like people, and actually focused on fixing it, then maybe.... Just maybe, after 76 possibly recovers, maybe 2k will see this as a sign to try to fix evolve, and I can sit them together, not as dead games that I enjoy, but games that I believed could rise again above the graves of their pasts..... If Todd and Bethesda fixes 76 without the help of modders... Maybe they might have a chance to have a reputation that isn't lazy, cheap, lying, penny pinching, incompetent makers, and maybe their reputation can rise up to reputation rank 2 (redeemable makers?)

Ok I'm finished spilling my toxic tongue, my frustration and tears, and hopeless heartful belief of redemption, let the possible toxic defenders unleash hell apon me, and like Todd, I'll ignore it in cryostasis.... Or while huffing jet because at this point I'll need a drug addiction cheaper than Bethesdas subscriptions",2019-11-14T08:59:32Z,1,0

Clearly, there was a lack of passion behind the game and it shows. What I see is that since Starfield and Elder Scrolls VI are going to be such sought after title, Bethesda needed as much funding as they could get. So, what better way to get that funding by haphazardly throwing together an online Fallout title (which some fans have been wanting) and milking it dry. Although, I don't think Bethesda thought they'd see the kind of backlash that's occurring currently, which will only backfire for their upcoming titles. As someone who is a die-hard Elder Scrolls fan, it's always disappointing to see this kind of behavior from them. Obviously I hope things get better, but it's a tentative hope.",2019-11-09T21:52:09Z,0,0

I just wanted to point out to anyone who is still around here for this game, that as of this moment 76 stands at $40 ($30 at some locations,) which is literally the EXACT same price as Fallout 4  at the same time, give or take $10. Fallout 4, a game that was released 4 YEARS ago, costs the SAME as a game that isn't even ONE YEAR OLD! smh... Personally I LOVE Fallout 4, to this day still, simply because I have modded out all the bad, modded in some good, and tweaked/patched the engine to my liking, and tbh it still baffles me how much flak Fallout 4 got when you consider the facts; New Vegas and Fallout 3 both used the same engine as Oblivion and those both got amazing reviews and opinions, yet Fallout 4 (and 76 tbh) use Skyrim's Creation Engine, an engine based on the Fallout 3/Oblivion engine of course, gets panned as if it was a terrible game and engine, when in fact it was a new engine and looked leagues better than both NV and FO3.

So AFA Bethesda and the whole Fallout 76 thing goes, I truly think they should just accept that this game did NOT live up to expectations, and while I am sure people would like to see an MMO built in the Fallout lore, I think this proves that a Fallout MMO is more than just a bad idea; it goes against what Fallout fans really want from Fallout games, which is a great story to experience in the virtual world. The sooner Bethesda realizes this, gets to work on a new Elder Scrolls and game engine (historically, Elder Scrolls games produce the game engines used for Fallout games,) the sooner a better Fallout successor can actually get released.",2019-11-07T02:48:43Z,0,0

Even if all of the glitches and technical problems were fixed, my core gripe is that you CANNOT PLAY THE GAME AS INTENDED.


What do I mean by that? I mean the entire point of Vault 76 is ""Rebuild America"". You cannot even build a communal SETTLEMENT. There is zero collective permanence. Because you cannot guarantee getting back onto the server you last played on, and because everything you build goes with you when you log out, everyone is down to picking up and putting down their personal homesteads... and that's it.


The rest of the game is just a theme park with a lot of shooting in between. If I play it at all in future, the only way I would is as a TOURIST OF WEST VIRGINIA. Screw PvP, screw scavenging, don't care about loot, why bother? Not even death means anything. Just travel the Appalachains with a stove, a sleeping bag, and a rifle.",2019-09-04T17:37:04Z,0,0

First - the Bethesda servers bottlenecked me at 300 kb/s so it took 60 hours to download. Then when I ran it... I thought... omg... this looks slightly worse than Fallout 4. I have a Alienware PC gaming ststem 3.5 Ghz with RTX 2080 and I'm experiencing framerates around 12 fps in certain sections. Sometimes it just locks up for no reason while the persistent game world continues on without me. But that's ok - because the game world is DEAD. LIFELESS. NO one to meet - no one to interact with. What a horrific piece of crap. Why didn't they just make FALLOUT 5? Fuck this online only crap. So I decide to ask for a refund and I'm told...

I had the game preordered tricentennial as a Christmas gift and regret having my family member get it for me.  I’ve launched over 10 nukes and half of them were on fissure sight and that itself is a fucking problem the final boss of the game is a buggy fucking mess. AND DON’T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE CRASHES!!!!!  Nuclear Winter is terrible and goes as such,  Loading screen waiting from 10 minutes to an hour to have people load in then picking a landing spot from a ton of boring locations, loading screen, either die via being killed at spawn, or killed while moving into the circle, or winning which can be incredibly easy when having a server full of rank 0’s and 1’s who just started. You can get rewards for playing but the levels are ridiculous and if people are willing to dump 80+ hours to get a power armor paint or a gun skin.

He can show you a turd and still sell it to you.

He's basically A version of Peter Molyneux who knows how to restrain his over the top statements and wrap people around his little lies and wordplay's.

I hate it as years ago I actually believed Todd was the spine of the game company that made some of the best ideas, much like Kojima.
Turns out he's just the talker that blinds people with sweet words.
The dev team does the real good work, and they are being forced to dumb down and reduce everything thanks to the higher ups that know selling a half asses game that's hyped up brings up more then a deeply invested polished product.
Problem is this will not make them rich on the long run and likely to run Bethesda into the ground.",2019-08-11T12:24:15Z,0,0

I have never played fantasy game before W3. 

But ... when i see the guy in his leather jacket on the stage with his beautifull haircut talking bullshit i think about one thing and one thing only ""We bought this jacket and this haircut"". So ... why the game studios as CD Projekt  or ND should care about good quality of Cyberpunk or TLoU2? When they really can sold us crap and earn money? We players as community eat shit . The truth  is that as gamers we really don't deserve for games as W3 and TLoU2.
ND and CD projekt Red and few others, do this not beacuse we deserve it. They are doing this beacuse they are true players. Not us. 

Sorry for my poor language.
Take care.

I have played from the start... all the glitches, bugs,  weapon nerfing, camp closures, blue screening, other kicking fr no reason, updates fro hours on end, ghouls that slide across floors that you cant kill, falling through game floors, legendary monsters you spend thousands of ammo on that drop 1 star scrip,  and now the new vending machines that for no reason just empty you whole inventory so you camp doesn't show up on the map and you have to populate and price every item you sell over and over (sometimes 120 vending slots) I've had enough.... don't buy it really... and every update and bug fix they do... another pops up worse, and every new event they bring out you still get crap if you complete it.... its the best concept but the worst game I have ever played... maybe some players should start suing them. IT IS NOTHING BUT  DIGITAL COCONUT SHY WITH ALL THE DAMN COCONUTS NAILED TO THE SHY POSTS... you try for a while but after throwing the balls hundreds of times as hard as you try the coconut just don't fall off... when a game is no longer fun, it is no longer a game.... this is utterly crap.... I just though if something else crap too... and then forgot whil typing... and I really cant be arsed even trying to remember any more.... IT IS SHIT.... YOU WILL GET BURNED.... oh yes i remembered... now it lags like cray.... so when your in battle r like rd zone - you lag - and just end up waking up a bag on the floor with all you junk in - if you do get back and pik it up before another player takes it your lucky... and if you get to beat the monster your fighting guess what... you still usually get 1 start scrip... f*ck all incentive - 101% frustration and pissed off... but dont believe me - go on and spend you well earned money on it and find out for yourself... good luck...

And CD Projekt Red is a tiny team compared to Bethesda, which is a massive developer/publisher.


Actual QC? Making promises they could keep? Being quite aware that their brand is in danger of suffering permanent damage if they fool players again? Taking their work seriously? Spending more time on making the game than sending a self-centered manchild out to lie on stage?


I love Todd Howard, but I just want to smash his face in at this point. Here's a game which was released in the state of an advanced alpha, which took several steps back from a game which already took a few steps back, which is dipping its toes into one of the most difficult types of games out there (MMORPGs, which live and die with their balancing, stability and high-end content), which is literally plagued by bugs which were present and fixed in Fallout 4 and he's acting like everything is fine.

Look I love fallout don't get me wrong, but Bethesda might have well shot themselves with this one, I really hope that fallout 76 is that ""one game"" that doesn't count for anything in the lore. 

Fallout, if continuing on its current path is marching toward it's grave. Command and conquer did the same thing, they had their amazing games, creating a loved universe for its followers and making a great genre of gaming, they had their retro first 2 games made by one company, got bought out by EA, had another game made C&C 3 Tiberium wars(with a few spinoffs, But for consistency's sake were sticking with the tiberium universe) with an amazing sequal game in the form of C&C 3 Kane's wrath.  but they made one major fuck up afterward, they bought into what other companies were doing, that's when C&C 4 was released, a retcon of lore, old gameplay styles throw out the window and built from the ground up (and not for the better).then after many community outrages and bad reviews, and a attempt at making things better via announcing another game(C&C Generals 2) that would be better going back to its roots. Then when they canceled it, the whole series died, C&C lost its identity and went away from their formula and payed the price, almost exactly as fallout is doing now. They had their OG retro games (Fallout 1 & 2) Their Bethesda games (Fallout 3 and NV) (And yes I know that NV was made by obsidian but stick with me here) now their version of C&C 4 has come about (Fallout 76) a game that literally went away from formula, fucked the lore, and utterly flipped off the fan base with shitty marketing and other bullshit like that Nuka dark, the messenger bag, and literaly everything else about this game (something that C&C didn't do, thank god) 

 Hopefully Bethesda wakes up and smells the coffee because if they don't, fallout as we know it is completely and utterly fucked. and no I'm not trashing Bethesda or fallout don't get me wrong, I love fallout, (I got so deep into the lore) but In the end I don't want the same thing to happen to another game I love to death like it happened with Command and conquer.

Also if you acted as a dick it would really make the npc hate hate you where as in fallout 4 you just get an angry comment but then the npc acts as if it never happened and when you act good in fallout 4 theres no benefits whatsoever

The dialogue is gone and the wild factor is gone. For instance the dead money dlc on new vegas sick and as simple as the 108 vault in fallout 3 (Gary). But even with the terrible aiming still had a sick story with sick exploration. In my opinion and I mean my opinion I would make some some sick dlcs and story lines for fallout 3 & new Vegas. I know people want better graphics and etc but to me it's become so much on graphics and money just like eso you have to pay 15$ month just to somewhat play the game and it's not that good.

Things like that shouldn't be too harshly scrutinized in early release. I know when I write this it's later on and have made some decent changes and patches to fix those hilarious but immersion breaking glitches. But Bethesda studios did screw up pretty bad with fallout 76. They are better at making games with ACTUAL VOICED PHYSICAL CHARACTERS. But 76' screwed the pooch with it's idea of outright removing human/ghoul/super mutant NPC's. I like having a character giving me a quest rather than finding a fuckin holotape,  robot, or terminal that gives me one instead. The Nuke launching idea was an interesting and bold concept, but failed in making some sort of attempt to actually add some kind of terrain damage elements. (Me when I launch my first nuke at level 28)""Oh yeah let's nuke the Whitespring hotel and see what kind of loot lies in the wreckage"" *Nukes it* ""Alright probably nothing left of it"" *Sees hordes of feral ghouls and building is completely unharmed* ""WHERE THE FUCK DID ALL THESE GHOULS COME FROM AND WHY IS THERE A PRISTINE BUILDING HERE?!😲"" like seriously, did I drop a nuke or an M80 firecracker?",2019-03-21T02:46:21Z,0,0

The only game I ever played was Fallout: New Vegas and that was fun tbh. However, since I want to get into new games as I'm tired of the same old COD, BF and EA Sports and 2k games I figured why not try Fallout. Fallout 76 *was* going to be my first ever Fallout game I purchased. Keyword *was*. This game was so hyped up and what a let down. I'm so glad I did not purchase this game. I honestly feel so bad for all the Fallout fans. Between the game being absolute shit, to the micro transactions (trust me I know a lot about both), to the fact that they literally ripped you guys off with the ""canvas"" duffle bag and the nuka dark rum. Oh and not to mention that platers got banned for no fucking reason and had to write an essay, yes a fucking ESSAY as an apology. It may seem like I've played the game a lot but I haven't in years. I just heard what was going on from AngryJoe and YongYea. Again, I feel for you guys I really do. And that's saying something considering 99% of my games are from Activision and EA.

The game was released unfinished due to over commitment, while yours is due to deception. What you are doing is much worse since there is a big difference between over commitment and deception, and that difference is intent. Shortly after release, the Hello Games devs admitted their mistakes and redeemed themselves by spending the next few years improving the game (and they still are), at no additional cost and without micro transaction BS. Because of all this, Hello Games has been mostly forgiven and is now a respected company. If they can do it with a MUCH smaller dev team, why can’t you? If Final Fantasy 14 can do it, why can’t you? There is no excuse. This is why you have lost all respect and credibility. Sure, you haven’t had years to redeem yourselves like they have, but two months in, you’re still not on the right path like they were in the first 2 months. 

Those who don’t learn from history are doomed to repeat it. And yet, it seems you’re intent on doing exactly that. Remember Mass Effect Andromeda? There is a lot of history there.",2019-03-09T15:20:43Z,0,0

There have actually been treatises written on this subject: Google “The Mythical Man-Month,” an entire manuscript written on management of development teams, one of whose core, objective observations is that more man-hours don’t equal a better product, and fostering productivity or good practice cannot be done simply by scaling horizontally. The hypertrophy resulting from such a mishandling of the team would only be further compounded by leadership obsessed with only deviating from old, outworn gameplay mechanics and formulae which aren’t well suited to a totally open world of tens or hundreds of concurrent players just so they could say that they did, and probably contributed to why none of the proprietary technologies and design Bethesda needed to build around the user experience of meaningful cooperation and progression almost from the ground up for the architecture of an always-online game pass cursory examination: The claims of “All-new rendering technologies” are probably actually descriptive of where effort was invested because atmosphere is where Bethesda games have historically derived value and become exemplars. This is where studios  could have compartmentalized, likely had some personnel who specialized, and probably would have both made a stellar showing and released on time if they had been made to deliver the single player campaign promised to long-time fans, let alone revamped assets to keep up with strides made in availability and scalability of processing power under consumer’s desks. 

Instead these improvements are completely absent, as are updated mechanics to keep up with the responsive feel of innumerable competitive shooters crowding markets or cope with the technological demand of Planetside-2-scale real-time cooperative PvE. Bethesda failed to lure any new blood, and left die-hard fans with a bad taste in their mouth from the over-hyped and bungled implementation alongside the affront of simply opting not to release any of the aforementioned single-player. Sure Todd, you had lots of programmers. You probably managed to write lots of code. Programmers probably worked on lots of each others’ code. In other words, you moved fast. But you probably also broke things. You made heaps and heaps of half-boiled, brittle spaghetti code whose engineers were too scattered by your release cycle to maintain.

Presto West Virginia. Todd Howard admitted himself that with their creation kit it allows them to build complete cities and landscapes very very fast. With scrap everything you can literally scrap the ground and entire world space in about 1 hour. So lets be generous and say it took a week to auto generate the map. Cause that's what they do. literally hit a button and let the space create itself. Then they go in and move a tree here and place a rock there. Okay so moving on to NPC- 15 seconds. The amount of time it took to right click the NPC folder in fallout 4 and hit delete.  Clutter and static garbage in the game 10 minutes- 15 seconds to right click copy and paste. 9m45s to change the color on a few. the 3-4 ""different"" enemies in the game. We'll be a little more generous on this one and say a day and a half-36 hours. 15 minutes to copy and paste them from their other games- 35 1/2 hours to wait for email from Caliente(Outfit Studio)giving them permission to use Bodyslide- 15 minutes to add outfits to the ghouls- Not Scorch beasts- FO4 ghouls. Story line- 0 minutes. End game battle 30 seconds- 10-15 to copy and paste it in there- 10-15sec to decide which dragon looked the coolest from Skyrim. So where are we roughly now- a week and a half. Now we can be generous once again and say that it even took a year cause I did forget one thing- 50 1/2 weeks to figure out the best way to fuck us in the ass and integrate the Atomic Shop and how to creatively scratch every extra dime they can out of us. So 1 year. If there is anybody out there that believes their bullshit that 4 different studios have been working on this piece of shit game for 3-4 years non-stop GIVE ME A FUCKING BREAK. Wake up and smell the coffee. This game was literally made over the course of a long weekend to leach any extra dollar they can get out of you until they figure out how to make a quality game.

If you do, prepare to be MASSIVELY disappointed, even EB Games are warning potential buyers that game is totally unstable. In the space of 15 mins whilst having achieved L50 after 2+months, the game [DISCONNECTED FROM SERVER] 5 times and then refused access because ""account not authorised"".........it is a legit copy downloaded from Bethesda onto a PS4 Pro.


The game will start out relatively stable, then they will carry out ""upgrades/servermaintenance"", the gmae will become unplayable as a result for a number of days, then they will find a ptach to almost fix the problems, then you will get a period of relative stability (as in, you can almost get an uninterrupted hour before it falls over) before the next ""server maintenance""......then the shit starts all over. It has been this way since the day I made the mistake of buying it.

The corporate financial is taking over (just like in Blizzard and EA a long time ago) and Tod is practically in a really bad situation where hes badly limited in resources but has to hype the product as usual. 
Do you seriously question his abilities after such a portfolio? 
He is a company man. If he said the game wad issues he would get fired and also net be able to get a job with anyone else other than open up his own company which would prevent him from designing because he would waste his time on startup and focus on management. etc. etc. 
Don't be surprised if he leaves. Everyone from Blizzard did. 
Remember that quote - ""You either die a hero or live to become the villain"" 
Such is the faith of all Companies and in life in general 
Google, Amazon, Apple etc. 
They play and have a genuine human line when small and starting up but in the end its all about maintaining power among other big fish . I haven't played Fallout 76, and while I get your frustration don't be blind to the realities of finance. We all wear it on our sleeve. Tod is practically held on gunpoint.

I'm surprised you didn't mention the fact that the game blue screens constantly. Even to this day. Side not I bought all the dlc's to fallout 4 and to this day cant even play the animatronic one because the first mission had a glitch where you cant grab a thing you need off a dead robot lmao. I couldn't agree more and I didn't even look at internet reviews about it till after I played it. I didn't want to c anything about it and spoil anything, even tho i prolly should have in retro spec. so the internet didn't tarnish my opinion in any way.

I knew it was gonna be shit, but not to this degree. It isn't even an individual Fallout game. Looks more like shitty Fallout 4 DLC. We didn't need another Fallout game. We had Fallout 4(which is a pretty damn good game and doesn't deserve the flak it got), Fallout New Vegas, Fallout 3, etc to hold us over untill the next true Fallout game. We needed them to focus all their attention on TES 6 so it doesn't turn out to be a total flop like this ""game"". Fuck this game and it's stupid, unwanted, buggy, glitchy, trainwreck of a face!

Aso, a lot of the points you mentioned also apply to Mount & Blade Bannerlord. What a god awfrul ""Early Access"" game at $40, amost full price and the insolent fanboys that defend it even to this day are the definition of ""delusional"" and ""double standard"". Early Access games should be FREE to $5 MAX because you are testing a game, not playing it's full release. Valve needs to clean up it's early access games that are just milking players dry and have an EARLY ACCESS category to organize Steam and give the boot to early access games that will never be finished.",2019-02-07T11:12:30Z,0,0

He said that when games went to (digital distribution), game companies would <paraphrasing> ""ship first, patch later.""  When I played my first PC game back in 1991, RAM was $100 per megabyte and a good hard drive was 40 mb.  RAM is now about $20 a gigabyte and drives are measured in terabytes.  All that memory and storage come at a steep price--rushed games, cash-grab Pre-Order content, micro-transactions and game companies owned by shareholders.  

I had not seen Todd Howard's E3 presentation and interviews for Fallout '76, but now that I've seen clips in this video, I can tell that Howard was lying: 1) No gameplay video at E3, 2) Ringers in the audience who clap and cheer like they're at a political rally, 3) Almost no blinking from Howard in the interview, and when he does blink, it's too long--giving away that he knows he's lying.  I've seen politicians do the same thing.

One good thing is that Bethesda stockholders will dump their holdings making stock prices plummet.  That is a good time to buy stock--rock-bottom prices!  Bethesda can then use the influx of cash to build a new engine and keep their promises with ES Vi.

If you're unwilling to buy Bethesda stock, then you can help Bethesda make better games in two other significant ways---STOP pre-ordering games and never complete a micro-transaction! Make them EARN your money.  Oh, and you can also wait six months before buying ANYTHING from Bethesda.  Oh, I'm sorry, you WANTED to be a beta-tester for a full-priced game, my mistake.",2019-01-16T03:02:34Z,4,145

Most the problems are with the severs rendering and processing all the players. That being said, a lot of those issues have been fixed (note I said a lot not all). NPCs and a great solo story couldn't be in this game because the way multiplayer games like this work. Other players would kill NPCs need for quest and it makes no sense to have them be invisible. If you don't want to just cheat the game by looking up codes or trapping enemies you don't have to. You don't often see players to began with so others doing this does really affect you. If you want to respec, you make a new character like in lot of other games that want you to put some thought into it. This game is met for you to become better by a better understanding of the game. Which means, you do well and have an enjoyable experience by restarting after you get to the point where you one shot enemies to reinvest your perk points in a better way making for a new playstyle. Their isn't a real great story but their is a ton of lore that you can find if you look for it making the game intresting. Lastly, earning atom is really easy, you don't need to buy atom. And the stuff in the atom shop is cosmetic so, whats your point. You saying that the game is bad isn't really true; talking about the servers is a little different. If you said that the game was good but dull at times, however the servers were buggy and took away from the experience, I would say that is much more fair then, this game sucks because it has bugs and I got to the point where it was easy.",2019-01-15T04:00:44Z,0,0

It completely fucking nullifies the existence of President Eden in Fallout 3. He was suppose to be a state of the art post-War super-computer, something that humanity didn't even completely have before the bombs. He was suppose to lead the Enclave for years, not needing term limits and being incapable of human-error. But *_no!_* It turns out West Virginia of all places has these super-computers, while places like the fucking Capital of the United States doesn't.
I enjoy Fallout 76's gameplay. I can look past bugs and unfinished content. But when they retcon and incorrectly reference _their own fucking lore_ it really ticks me off, and makes me wonder about the writing capabilities of Bethesda.",2019-01-10T00:28:30Z,0,0

The only real issue I seem to have, is managing my stash of 600 weight between my gear and crafting materials, and am kinda upset there's no actual NPC characters besides robots an shit. 

Other than those two complaints, I don't see where people get off; in all likliness they probably have no idea how game development works, and neglect the idea that many studios refrain from even making online games because of the testing needed to solve hiccups, and the complaints people give it anyways. Sure SINGLEPLAYER Bethesda games were more solid previously, but with online games, things cannot be fixed until servers and the game are worked out by players stress testing everything. Code may work perfectly fine until it is stressed. This is exactly why they just increased the stash from 400 to 600 and say they will continue to increase it as long as it doesn't effect the game. 

People bitching doesn't help solve anything, and if they blindly keep it up, we can pretty much guarantee Bethesda refrains from adding multi-player to their games in the future...especially when the fan base has come to expect too much because they have this molded idea in their head of what a fallout game should be.

This same thing goes for Assassins creed titles and many other games; Assassins creed Unity came out and despite being fun but half ass, people just bitched and complained and picked apart every damn detail (saying little about what was good), and since then, how many online/coop Assassins creed games have we seen? Despite people thinking that Bethesda is God, and how could they create such garbage when they are a legend company, people need to clearly understand that despite the quality of their past games, for Bethesda online games aren't their specialty...but that doesn't mean things cant change or get better, they just need proper feedback instead of all of this sheer hatred.

Everything about this game, including the fact that they didn't include human NPCs says that they tried by the hair on their balls to get a base working online fallout game that wouldn't be stressing by itself...and instead of people seeing the flaws and choosing to commend Bethesda for actually trying and for considering future online Fallout games in the first place...people just see the flaws and bitch some more. It's clearly because they know nothing about actual development, or they've never really played the game (its a fact; so many people talking crap about this game have never even played it). 

BTW, there are so many games worse than this selling for the same or more price, getting Fallout 76 even in the condition it is in and with the (few) problems it may have, is a steal for only $30. I'd rather have my money back for buying ""For Honor"" when it was $50 (the player toxicity I experienced and the disproportionate power between warriors made the game one sided and completely game breaking). I'd also like my $60 back for buying Call of Duty WW2 (having been a huge fan of COD WAW, in COD WW2 all guns felt like they did close to the same damage, while bolt action rifles took 2-3 bullets to kill someone and yet shotguns were 1 shell kills from nearly across the map, nothing was ever fixed and they only nerfed what guns were good)...

Before getting Fallout 76, I was with everybody else thinking it was garbage because of what people were already saying... but after spending many hours playing, I truly feel like people have their head up their ass and simply can't see the good things about the game... and that's despite nothing being what they advertised, 16 times the detail ect ect... Its like Nvidia always claiming their latest GPUs are 3-4x faster when it may only be 20-30% or so faster than the previous card, people have got to be ignorant (lacking in understand when concerning hardware) to believe there was that large of an increase... Same goes for Fallout; you'd have to be ignorant to believe they could get 16 times more detail over Fallout 4; its just stupid to even say and was clearly and undoubtedly a sales gimmick. Even with my little experience in 3D work and game development, I can say with 100% certainty before even seeing gameplay, that those words were complete and utter bullshit. This is why I said ""ignorant"", because these companies say things like 4x faster or 16x more detail, because they know that people who truly don't know better, will eat it up.... ""But Wait, pay $19.95 and call in the next 15mins and receive a second copy for FREE! That's right, for FREE, just pay a small shipping and handling fee of $19.95"" ...

All the stuff you bitch about like a crybaby isn't half as bad as you pretend it to be. If you don't like it? That's fine. But being biased just because of that and deny a actual good (but flawed) game some praise? Fuck off.

I really liked you. You were my number one source for reviews for the past years. But with this biased bullshit. This dogshit review you put up here, just to shit on Fallout 76 and cash in on the hate-train going on, that left a big dent in my trust in you with reviews. 

And you proven me right as well. You did let get Rockstar away with their predatory business practices that was with RDR2 Onlines microtransactions. Not even given a fuck about it. But you completely destroyed Bethesda for having some cosmetics in their shop. 

For that i desubbed from you. And everytime i try to watch your reviews now i will try to get a different opinion or even try the game myself in the future before believing you. Not that you should give much of a fuck yourself. Your fanboys with gratefully just jerk you off as much in their circlejerk hate-train.

I've always been curious of the hype around the fallout series so I came to check this video out. I'm partial to the medieval magical elements of the elder scrolls over fallout but my younger brother likes the series so I want to have more knowledge of it (so we actually have something to talk about for a change).

I mean hell I'll even take a partial refund at this point in exchange for this dumpster fire of a game. Please TAKE IT!! Give me $30 and TAKE IT AWWWAAAYYYY!!!! What's even scarier is that starting this month, they're going to start releasing more content patches. What? Really? More content when you haven't even FIXED your buggy performance issues! Instead of fixing the problem, they're going to add more content that'll soon make the problem alot more enriched. Bethesda has released more than 70gb worth of patches claiming they'll fix their performance, glitch and bug issues but it hasn't.. those ""patches"" actually made game-play alot worse. 

Here are a few current examples (this all was on 1/2/2019). Enter power armor, crash.. Launched a nuke, crash.. killed a three star level 68 albino death claw; fell through the map (went back to loot and my bag wasn't there while trying to loot the DC and got the loading wheel of doom).. went to trade 2-3 star gear to a friend; game crashed and all gear (AAALLL TRADED GEAR) was lost upon reload.. entered in a nuke zone with party; all party members booted to XBox start screen except me (it was lag even-though we were the ONLY group in it).. fast traveled to my camp; half of my camp was glitched in the ground while walls on the other half were missing (that was actually a neat glitch because I was able to go into my camp and glitch in the ground to my forever falling doom lol).",2019-01-04T03:03:29Z,1,31

The game is made for developers (modders), around an idea of potential. Marketing is done too aggressively in the assumption that the game has reached it's potential at the day of launch.

Sadly, this backfired hard. Relayed the development on community, since community likes to do that in the eyes of studio. Charging full price for doing the job for them is most backwards thinking you can imagine. Nevertheless there will always be those loyal for the franchise and driven to just  that. They should have let the community work on the game in closed beta for a year and then launch it at full price. Alternatively release 76 as $30 DLC for Fallout 4. That would have been wiser move that standalone claim as triple A title.

Developers like the potential of 76 as raw gem
Average consumer feels like he/she got scammed

I bet there is fundamental flaw within the Bethesda, it's lack of clear communication between departments. Extremely common issue in large companies that eventually breaks it apart. Development bloating the current state in front of owners and marketing department. Marketing takes that and sells it as the ambitions were actually true. Results are in, a product that ruins the entire imago of trusted company. You can see this happen in larger companies despite the field of profession.",2019-01-02T18:50:57Z,0,0

I’ve been trying to get into this game but there have been soo many flaws. If you’re going to make a big map like this you better fill it. For one I’m a huge hoarder when it comes to scraping. I get being overcombered but lack of storage in your stash ruins that for me. In an hour of game played the server crashed 4 times. What’s the point of claiming a workshop and putting the effort in to defend it if your server drops you ever 15-20 min and lose it anyway. It literally looks like they took fallout 4 and added trees which btw are mostly 2d. I’m upset because I truly did like fallout 4 and this is just a disappointment.

The lever action gun still reloads five times even if you fire only once and the power armour issue is still a thing somehow. There are plenty of other issues and it just makes me angry. I had honestly forgotten about all the things said at the announcement and how they're all missing or a terrible representation at best. There is absolutely no way that so many studios worked on this Fallout 4 mod. No wait I take that back. Modders wouldn't release such a half-assed piece of crap. Modders have standards.,2019-01-01T03:37:40Z,0,0

How many people is Todd Howard in front of? There are probably investors in that audience, customers, media people. Its ridiculous what the yget away with. Granted im actually extremely amazed at Hello Games and what theyve updated No Mans Sky into, its not even the same game anymore as release day and it seems to be just developing more and more every month. Its quite incredible. You can see they are dedicated to the product. bestheda does not have that excuse.

It's NEVER going to happen because spoiled kids with parents who don't know how to say no will always exist, but it's the ONLY thing that these asshats will pick up on these days. Could you imagine how quick Activision Blizzard would increase the quality of their product if Call of Duty: The Next One sold as close to ZERO copies as is humanly possible? No pre-orders, no sale of special editions, multiplayer playerbase of less than a thousand worldwide. They would TURN AROUND and SHAPE UP in SECONDS. They would look at what the playerbase is asking for and they'd DO IT. But it'll never happen, because people are too apathetic to affect that kind of global change.

I wasn't interested in the game from the start because of the multi-player aspect. But I followed how it was doing in the stores and I noticed that the prices dropped on an almost daily basis. It sells now for the same price as a game that's out there for more then 2 years - at least in my home country. 

The biggest problem is that publisher studios like Bethesda (as a publisher, not the actual game makers ) or EA are only interested in a quick buck at the stock market. What they get via actual sales does not really matter.
Only the number of sales. Stores could retail a game for the purchase price, the publisher wouldn't care as long as the number of sold copies are the ""correct"" numbers at the right time. That is why Andromeda was rushed out, that is why that other game your talked about was ditched and Fallout 76 copy-pasted together because maybe they could bring out that one by the end of 2018. 

Aaand this could happen again with TES6. 

Just look at the release date of a game from a major publisher like EA, hold yourself back for about 2-3 months (not primarily because of patching!) -and then buy with all the possible bugs and glitches. That will hurt them.",2018-12-31T01:59:56Z,0,0

one person says ""it just works"" doesn't mean it actually does. Delusional? Maybe.  Loved the audience's lackluster response to the cheaped-out no
 NPCs in-game, or better yet, human interaction which apparently consists of live people wandering the game. Killed it for me right there . Cheesy robotic quests?...jeez! And the bit about buying things to make it workable and up to par...the temerity of marketing greed! But clearly it appeals to those to whom winning is paramount - a virtual gauge?  Yet the reality of it all says it's empty and non-existent, nonetheless.

To be fair, however, there are a many games that could benefit from upgrades, patches and mods. But am duly saddened by that wholesale marketing obfuscation, obviously engineered to take advantage of Fallout's broader fan base.",2018-12-28T12:02:18Z,0,0

Why bother finishing a game when they already have our money.

I have LOVED fallout since the original Isometric game came out in... 1998?
I heard about 76 and got super excited. Then I watched the event with that rat fuck bastard Tod Howard and knew that this was going to be a disaster. 
This flaming radioactive turn makes me fear for the future of the Fallout franchise.
Obviously noone that worked on this game had any love for Fallout. They missed everything that makes fallout great.

All he does is just make a big temper tantrum and state that his review was gospel. He made a mistake that every reviewer suffers from: he focuses on what ISNT there. Not on what there IS. What IS there is an environment that's fun to explore, survive in, and maybe do some pvp in. Sure there are tons of glitches, but skyrim had glitches too. LOTS of them. If your main complaint in a game is that it's glitchy, you need to explain how the glitches prevent the game from functioning. The only glitches I encountered were mostly graphical and based on AI, but the game wasn't corrupted beyond repair. It still functions well and is fun to play even without friends. And don't complain that the game feels empty. ITS SUPPOSED TO FEEL EMPTY YOU IDIOT! And look at the bright side, the less NPC's, the less annoying quests! The game still has quests, but they're all optional and are just there if you want some story. The quests are more about the journey than the destination in this game, but you still get rewarded for doing them. Now let's talk about the stash limit: I'm okay with it. I don't have anything against a stash limit. The only reason people are hating on this game is because they're just a bunch of idiots. They don't know how to properly review a game without a bias or explain why the design choices are bad. If you want to say something is bad, give a reason that is not lazy and is in-depth. The best example for a professional reviewer is a youtuber by the name of TGX. His reviews give an in-depth view of games and DESCRIBES their flaws instead of pointing them out. People are saying how bad fallout 76 is but they don't give a reason why. They haven't even PLAYED the game and are just blindly following what some drunk a-hole on the internet is saying. Anyways, enough ranting, my verdict is that the game is good, but is held back by glitches and a weird PVP system. 7/10 or a 6.5/10.",2018-12-26T23:32:49Z,7,0

If it was an mmorpg it would do much better with more community.  Large raids would be nice.  Making large community would be nice.

i can say the graphics are literally Fallout 4 and nothing else

the atom shop is ok i guess since 80% of it can be unlocked by finding their blueprints and getting a 1000 shop-points is usually equal to 6 hours of gameplay 
(although i was also raising all kind of red flags at first)

i would give the game a 6,5/10 but then again neither i nor my brothers paid the release price 

money for quality i would say

35-40$  6-7/10

60$   4-5/10

Now, the big B duct-taped a Fallout online game to pay for Elder Scrolls 6 to be finished.  So, that's what this game is -- it's paying for Elder Scrolls 6.  
I know it sucks, guys, but you're paying for Elder Scrolls 6 to be funded.  The question is ... are you happy about that?  I'm not.  
Bethesda, put everyone's pay on credit, and pay it off with pre-orders.  Turn a profit on release day.  Pay for DLC with whatever you make after the initial release.  Have some sort of plan, Bethesda.  Don't tape some games together, hype them up, and then give us this hot mess experience that will make us leery about buying your next game.

Cannot compare graphics...but the mechanics of the game were spot on and while hard, at highest level, were achievable because they worked brilliantly.  Fast forward 26 years and I cannot play to FO 76 and I cannot play it because the mechanics are shit.  

My old PC (that I still use to play legacy titles) has 128 megs ram, a 486-66 processor. a 40 Gb HDD, and a 4 Mb VGA video card and the old full implementation of DOS...good for the time but not great.  It plays DOOM better than my current gaming monster plays FO 76.  One reason...the old game was resident the new game is via their servers.  

So we sacrifice gameplay for scenery.  If im forced to choose 1 id rather have wicked game mechanics in a so so enviornment...I can watch a movie later.  

So, I have a monster PC running a game that does not work very well, that requires about 100 Gb of storage, clearly requires more than the min recomm sys req, forces you to be online... (so game play is automatically effected by any connectivity issues), and we've clearly moved the franchise to survival battle royale...with no story reveal other than through horribly depressing tapes, quests that are meaningless, and meatheads flailing about the countryside looking for someone to shoot...something that should make little sense given the story...but is clearly a design expectation given that there is no penalty for killing other survivors.  

GREAT GAME!!!",2018-12-21T15:32:55Z,0,0

Also the go where you want, and do whatever you want is a LIE!
I can not dual-wield melee or ranged weapons (Even though in their video a girl is dual-wielding guns), I can not build a huge base like I can in ARK, I want to repair and drive vehicles but nope NO vehicles, I can not choose the server to join,  no PVP server to chose to join, I can not climb a wall, no zip lines,  no preserving options for my food, I can not store my items in a separate container that is not shared with my stash, I can not move because i'm always over encumbered (Do what I want is loot stuff, I apparently can not do that),   I can not go anywhere for monsters tend to be way too high level and kill me in one hit.


Also some stupid shit like: no hatchet to chopping wood or pickaxes for ore, all we get is our fingers? WTF? They have Axes and pickaxes in the game but you can not use them for gathering materials. Also the log and ore never disappear. They just change how they look. Again WTF!

Water I get radiation if I drink it sure, but why do i get radiation for filling a bottle and then get more if I drink it? I can make stairs but I can not make a ladder?


Fallout 76 is missing so much, has way too many restrictions, has way too many bugs and glitches and one thing it has that it doesn’t need. CASH SHOP!


Then there is the STUPID Cash Shop! I WILL NOT PLAY a game with a CASH SHOP!

NPCs make games interesting, just look at Black Mountain Radio from Fallout New Vegas you pick it up in certain areas, you get tons of backstory from listening to it and then when you actually get there its a funny pay off that is memorable. Hell even not being able to send Fawkes into the reactor in FO3 was a meaningful interaction, you got to rage because the game was being dumb and excluding an obvious option. Look at the channel Bacon_ on YouTube. His entire channel is just NPCs in Oblivion being hilarious. 

Its just the easiest content to make is an NPC with voice lines that can be repeated out of context for meme purposes. You'd think they'd know that considering Oblivion had ""STOP RIGHT THERE CRIMINAL SCUM"" and Skyrim with their ""Until I took an arrow to the knee""",2018-12-19T03:27:14Z,1,0

Oblivion (2006):  Upon release, was a buggy piece of shit
Fallout 3 (2008): Upon release, was a buggy piece of shit (Certain versions are still nearly unplayable without fanmade patches)
Skyrim (2011): Upon release, was buggy to the point of unplayable
Elder Scrolls Online (2014): Upon release, was buggy to the point of unplayable
Fallout 4 (2015): Upon release was buggy to the point of unplayable

Why is everyone mad? Why was ANYONE expecting this to be different? Am i literally the only person in the world that saw Fallout 76 and said ""I'll give it a year or 2 for them to make it playable, then I may pick it up.""",2018-12-17T12:05:41Z,0,0

I predicted it would be direct F4 port with stripped content, and people went ""yo its beta"" .. beta is a polish stage and if you see major bugs, theyre still gonna be around in release.
Its tragicomedy, plain and simple.

I can honestly admit the game needs improvement and without argue it lacks story. However, the negative feedback constructed on Youtube from channels is demotivating Bethesda multiplayer experience. It is safe to say, unfortunately, the company will not pursue another multiplayer game in a while and focus on the one player solo series. This is personally affecting me and friends who purchased the game and actual cared to enjoy it. The game is filled with events you can involve yourself and missions which can pass the time. Nevertheless, the best part is the multiplayer. Try to make some friends and do not play by yourself. Socializing is a significant aspect of the game. I can guarantee is better and more enjoyable. Channels in Youtube just focus on hard details based on past games and there experience should not be yours. THIS IS NOT A FALLOUT SERIES CONTINUATION. It is a separate game itself even though it has lores which can enhance the player's fallout story interpretation. For credibility, I have been a successful Youtuber 2 times now both in Anime and Gaming industry. One thing I learned is to never trust what you hear in this platform until you confirmed it for yourself. If you still do not enjoy it after, go enjoy other games such as Red Redemption 2. I am not writing this and spreading this to change youtubers' mind on the game or pursue you to play it because again, that is your choice. The objective is to allow a thought on your minds as that what someone says here or anywhere to not affect your play and enjoyment. Think about it. How many people told you a movie was going to be bad and then when you watched it is a whole different experience. I enjoy the game.

I am completely disgusted with this company's turn to ""It's About The Money"" and not about the people who made them the at one time a ""Flagship"" AAA game company. Bethesda has now gone the way of EA Games. This bullshit started with Fallout 4 Bethesda doing the same thing other ""Low Budget"" gaming companies have done? They made their very own Call Of Duty style game. Fallout fans waited close to 9 years for Fallout 4 and we get a half-assed broken piece of shit that was not an RPG but an action shooter with RPG elements flaked in. Then came Fallout 76 a game that has no fucking clue what it wants to be?  These fuckers think us gamers are all a bunch of slack-jawed retards that are fine with whatever they chuck at us and call it a game! WE NEED TO MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND that we are not taking this shit anymore! Start by not buying anything they push no matter how bad you want it, it's only bait hint The ES VI.  DON'T BUY IT DON'T FALL FOR THIS BULLSHIT! Did anyone pick up on Tod's ""We are fine with the game engine we have"" bullshit? They tried making us think that having a completely empty world is a good thing because the players will be occupying it so no need for NPC?????? Are you fucking kidding me? What it does is make for a boring and lifeless void. I will not even get into the bugs that this mess is infested with. Then the complete fuck up with peoples information??? I WOULD FIRE EVERY MOTHERFUCKER INVOLVED! All in all Fallout 76 is a complete Dumpster Fire that needs to be extinguished and buried. Fuck you Tod Howard I'm done with you're fucking snide lying bullshit! You and Pete Hines should go and have a Butfuck session and leave the game making to people who give a fuck!

And ... The reason why in our days ALL games will be like this is the stupidity of the internet people and brainless fans who always say: they always can fix this things with a patch ... higher bandwith and early access makes people resistant against bad and buggy game designs which on one day will reach a level when there will games be released which wont contain anything until the players tell the developpers what to patch in and how to do it or which is even better and more likely the community will bring out own fixes and patches and mods to compensate the inability of the game developers.

And than you will pay for a ""full"" game which only contains an editor to Programm mods and other fixes... 

Next point is that they will give you content which is farm 1000000000 this or kill 1000000 this to get the quest done... they will make games so grindy (most fans will call it challenging ) that normal people would think: whoooaaaa... I coming home from 10h work and now I need to cut 1000000 trees to get my house-quest done... yeaaah.... in RL such people would tell you they wont do any work without getting payed for but in games its ok... there its called challenging or fun...

Buggy, Non existant or lame story, and overall boring gameplay... but boring as fuck...

Both fall in the same pit from same god damn reason: Greed

The Fallout shoud have remain what they are good... (excuse me)The BEST!    
Singleplayer, not but almost impeccable quality of gameplay, not by the Ai... the ai was never too smart in the bethesda game... But a the vast of options, options the gamers can affect the world, not respectively, but your all the time your actions have a consequence. Like far harbor Actually i was take negative teh first time when the charma system was cuted out from the F4 but later i realised, it's have a good purpose: Thinking out of the box, you can decide whic is good, bad or wrong.
But msot of it all they creat a massive sandbox area which have the basic pillar of gameplay, so you can play without bore yourself to death, but if you want more actions and content do your self, by FREE mods.

By the way i was Wrote off the Fallout 76 the very same moment when they said ""i'ts Multiplayer""
Don't misunderstand me:  They have not he experiance and kind a community wich are prefer a Coop Multipalyer. Especially in a survival game where blood and gore is every minute item... They have the experience to creat this as a Singleplayer and a Supporting commmunity to take it gladly, but not in multiplayer.

Look at Subnautica (I know the console release is terrible, it's very irritating) that game is old as hell but experiencing games like that for the first time is amazing. Bethesda should have looked at what made survival and exploration fun in Subnautica and try to carry over those qualities in their own game, if they want to make a survival game, look at what people did right in the genre and go from there. NOT this mess. Even without server issues or bugs the game isn't fun or interesting or creepy or ANYTHING that a survival game needs to be a good seller.

All their releases have always been more infested with bugs than the entire Fallout Wasteland they're trying to depict. They are the CTD and Glitch Kings yet also the most successful developers that a lot of people in the gaming industry -- including gamers and reviewers -- are more than willing to give an easy pass to just because their concepts and ideas are always top. Their final products though, quite franky... ultimately SUCK more than all the good things you can squeeze out of them. It's just a technical fuckfest of an ordeal players have to go through just to finish their games. It's the MODDING COMMUNITY that give their products such longevity and playability and that's where they can be given legit praise and credit in how easy it is to mess around with their primitive code. Otherwise they're overrated to the level of the Nine Divines just like Todd Howard is. Maybe it's time for them to look at using other much superior game engines out there.

But i still have a lot of fun, and to be fair, they adressed already like 30% of the rage inducing flaws mentioned in this video.
I am pretty sure this game gets in good shape the next Weeks/Months. 
They shouldnt release it that early, but for a company like Bethesda it should be way easier to perform a no-man-sky like U-turn.
Last Weeks patch, and the patch from yesterday were a pretty good start for that.

Clipping through the mountains, no textures for the river

Life is glitchy here, crappy rendered trees

Terrible LOD, here comes another freeze



Chorus:

Bethesda please, make a game

That I can play hours on

A better Fallout, like New Vegas

Without bugs, Bethesda please



All my old memories, of Fallout

Games were better, though the engine bugged out

Dark moral dilemmas, like a cloudy sky

Engaging NPC's, brought teardrops to my eye



Chorus Alt:

Country Roads, take me home

To a game, that belongs

Leaked my data, to the masses

Legal action, here we go



I hear Todd's voice, in the morning hour those tall tales

All the lies reminds me of Fallout games long ago

And drivin' home hard the feeling 

I should've seen this train wreck coming on months ago, months ago



Chorus:

Bethesda please, make a game

That I can play hours on

A better Fallout, like New Vegas

Without bugs, Bethesda please



Without bugs, Bethesda please



Without bugs, Bethesda please

EA (microtransactions and DLC is ridculous, fucked over plenty of games as of late like SW: Battlefront, ME: Andromeda, NFS, SimCity etc)
Konami (MGSV being unfinished, and their treatment of staff such as Hideo Kojima)
Sega (never again buying a TW game after the last few I played (latest being Warhammer 1), and also responsible for allowing Alien: CM to be released in the state it was in)

Semi-Boycott (Just because I reallllyyyy like some of their games so can't bring myself to boycott them completely):

Activision (Only play Destiny 2....but I still think they're dicks for allll the expansions/annual pass/microtransactions)
Ubisoft (similar to EA, also look at WatchDogs 1, several AC games, For Honor and more for disastrous games with lots of promise.....RBS: Siege is good though, and the last 2 AC games have been decent compared to some of the shittier titles they released like Unity)
Capcom (Only like the RE series, but again, their DLC practices and the way they treat consumers sucks)
Gearbox (I like Borderlands. But they completely fucked over Alien: CM and Duke Nukem Forever and didn't give a flying fuck about it)

Bethesda are in the last chance saloon with me with this whole Fallout 76 debacle. I think regardless how their next game(s) turn out, I will be getting ESVI regardless, just because of how big of a fan I am of that series. But if they somehow manage to make that game bad.....it will be the last time I ever buy anything from them. Honestly a bit worried that they might do something that will completely ruin the game though",2018-12-11T23:55:45Z,4,1

i feel sorry for whoever takes for granted the worlds of this clown
this is maybe the most under appreciated title of 2018
it is a true fallout experience hated mostly for all the wrong reasons 
true the game has many issues that needs to be fixed as they are doing now
but all this PETTY wave of people in the net saying ''oh LETS HATE BETHESDA BECAUSE IS THE COOL THING TO DO TODAY''
is just fucking disgusting 
i playing the hell out of this game, making a long in-depth solo series of it and everything and daily i wander,, what the fuck is so wrong with people spamming all this HATEWAGON?
Fuck it all i can say is that fallout 76 is at the very least FAR much more meaningful than this retarded overrated channel and holds more validity than stupis useless whining videos such this
i can guaranteed that most so called gamers hating on 76 haven't even played the damn game
i can also guaranteed that if this fallout game came before fallout 3, everyone would be loving the hell out of it despite all it's flaws

In hindsight, Bethesda has not fixed the bugs in Skyrim even after 7 years, so expecting them to fix it in 2 weeks was expecting too much. 

The part that pisses me off is the lies and the lack of effort put into it- it basically used the same engine as FO4, half of the assets were from FO4 and the same bugs that modders fixed in FO4 appeared again.

If this was a FO4 mod for $20, i would not buy it and wait for a mod version because at least they would care to make it interesting.",2018-12-11T22:15:24Z,0,1

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjrDbSgB9IU,Fallout 76 Angry Review,2018-11-27T06:20:30Z,@tomgardner9069,"*EXTREME GOLF CLAP FOR ANGRY JOE*  Honestly, my first connection to the Fallout franchise was Fallout 4.  I had heard the hype about the Fallout series and finally took the plunge because my girlfriend wanted it as well and bought Fallout 4.  Honestly, I was not impressed.  In fact, I was bored as shit.  I saw too many damned glitches and wondered what the fuck was the big deal about Fallout and Bethesda.  To be quite frankly honest with you, you might have just let EA Games get into the cookie jar on this one.  When it came time for Fallout 76, I asked my girlfriend if she wanted it because I didn't.  Her response was basically, ""Fuck no.""  Looking back, the graphics for Fallout 76 don't look any better than those in Fallout 4.  I wasn't impressed with those graphics, either.  

If I want a post-apocalyptic game, I'll stick with The Last of Us.  Naughty Dog at least gives a shit about their players.  Hell, the Mad Max game that came out a few years ago was a lot more fun and less glitchy than what I've seen from Bethesda's Fallout recently.  

What these game publishers need to understand is that it's better to do a lot of beta testing with the public, particularly on the open-world games that have so many variables where things can go wrong.  

On the buyers' side of things (yes, you, the Dorito and Mt. Dew crowd), quit pre-ordering....particularly from the publishers/devs who have a history of releasing half-baked/unfinished games for full AAA developer prices.  (Assassin's Creed:  Unity, anyone?)  

You're basically feeding the beast.  The more you buy from them, the more they're going to think that it's okay to keep doing this and keep releasing broken and unfinished pieces of shit to the market.  

Think of it this way:  if you go to a restaurant and get shitty service from the waiter/waitress (your drink isn't filled, nobody goes around and checks on you, your order is wrong, food's cold, etc)....do you tip them?  Do you go back to have the same thing happen to you?  Do you pay two months in advance for your shitty service/meal?  YOU GO SOMEWHERE ELSE...if you've got a brain in your head.

Sorry if this seems like I'm being an asshole, but I was in professional sales and saw a lot of shady shit done by sales personnel.  They basically lie to you about what to expect and give you the idea that whatever you're buying is life-changing...and then you wind up with an Ikea furniture kit missing half the pieces with instructions in an obscure dialect of Swedish that even Google Translate can't read.

What's going to happen is the video game industry is going to continue putting out half-baked shit as long as people are buying it.  Please refer to the Atari 2600 E.T. game, which was one of the most anticipated games at the time.  It ended up being one of the worst games--absolutely unplayable, and Atari almost lost their shirt over it.  The majority of their E.T. game cartridges ended up in a landfill.  If it hadn't been for Nintendo, home video gaming would have died out.  You don't believe me about video games in this day and age dying out?  History repeats itself.  

The only way that the gaming community is going to see reform is to quit pre-ordering.  Demand alpha-testing and beta-testing; hell, post-beta-testing if you can get it.",2018-12-11T18:17:39Z,0,0

The server does crash maybe once a night on me. Ya that sucks. The respawn sucks too. Ur constantly overincumbered. And the budged for ur camp build sucks. But i do like that u can play with friends. Lots of new stuff as well. Im gonna give them time to fix it and make it up to us. I strongly feel its not worth the price they were selling it at. But in all its still a cool game.

A reputable car dealership sells you a newer model of the car you used to drive at full price. You inquire about the technical aspects of the car, but all they can tell you is that ""it just works."" This rubs you the wrong way, but you're willing to overlook it because you've been buying from them for years and feel that they've earned your trust. On the way home, you discover a minor flaw with the steering wheel, but you shrug it off because you manage to find a way to work around it. Over the next couple of days, what you initially thought was one minor flaw reveals itself to actually be dozens of minor flaws that affect multiple parts of the car. So many minor flaws, in fact, that they all add up and become a major flaw that renders the car all but useless. You confront the dealership about it, hoping for the refund you clearly deserve, but the only thing they offer you is an air freshener and a bobblehead toy to put on your dashboard, along with a vague promise of ""fixing it"" in the indefinite future, as long as you're willing to identify the flaws yourself as they keep happening and report them accordingly because they themselves aren't even aware of how many flaws actually exist.

P.S to past,present and future devs, (1). stop the bullshitting and over hypeness of introducing games at events and advertised trailers, unless your 99.9% positive and confident you/s think your game is going to be that good (common sense!!). (2). listen to your fan base (NO MATTER WHAT YOU OR YOUR DEV TEAM THINKS OR SAYS)because we are the target consumer/Audience, not you devs, we are the ones you are trying to impress (OBVIOUSLY :/), (3). Be light on microtransactions or better yet go back to old school roots and cut them out completely, or with microtransactions, again (LISTEN TO YOUR FAN BASE FOR  CONSTRUCTIVE IDEAS AS TO WHAT ""WE"" WANT AS MICROTRANSACTIONS ""NOT JUST YOUR STUDIOS/TEAM IDEAS"")because we being your audience have some really good ideas and they just get brushed under the carpet, and those really great          Ideas could potentially earn you a better reputation for the company as well as revenue and your fan base, (BE MORE OPEN TO IDEAS AND SUGGESTIONS FROM ANYONE AS A WHOLE NOT JUST ON YOURS OR THE TEAMS TERMS PLZ!!). (4). Try to give your Dev Team/s, studio/s enough time to work on the game and if you cannot by any circumstance reach the deadline of release for a almost 100% functional game (DO NOT RELEASE IT PERIOD, NO MATTER IF ITS CHRISTMAS, EASTER AND BLAH BLAH BLAH, OTHER HOLIDAY SEASONS). (4). Before release (TEST! TEST! TEST! AND MORE TESTING! OF YOUR SELLING YOUR PRODUCT TO THE CONSUMER/AUDIENCE) you can't go wrong if your game functions and plays nicely from point A to point Z, and yes new bugs will arise from your fanbase/s, as well as your dev team may discover (OBVIOUSLY :/), but please in future iron out the most damaging, annoying and frustrating Major bugs first and then focus on the minors bugs the least or some what lastly, depending on what it is that could potentially turn into a bigger problem. Ok so that about wraps it up with my rant to any devs or wanna be devs out there, I shouldn't have to be writting a long ass comment about what a Lead Dev and his team/s should be doing to impress his consumers and fanbase, this should be on point all the time and every time, but I'm just one guy, like the rest of everyone globally with all different views and opinions. So happy gaming to everyone and let us rise up to these gaming developers and maybe with enough force from us players, we will have a big enough back bone to drive them to the point of listening to our forgotten words and wisdom, to create a better gaming world and experience for future generations to come.

I get to sit here in my throne of golden obviousness reminding you all that ""I told you so"".  I said the whole time that paid mods on consoles was the beginning of the end for Bethesda.  Oh it was a good run alright, but then we let them start charging us for something we used to do for free, and now continue to do so.  We told them: ""we want more meaningless bullshit we are more than willing to pay for"".  Well, I mean, YOU told them that, not me.  I was never stupid enough to fall for that scam.  They think all we want are big open worlds with a pretty sandbox and horizon, and stuff to buy, and lo and fucking behold: that's what they gave you.

What's worse is you let them put it on consoles only.  CONSOLES!  Don't get me wrong, I still have a console myself what I use regularly, BUT this was obviously a means to control the modding community as a means of easy income.  Bethesda knows that the independent modders are the lifeblood of their games on PC, which is why they brought them to console and forced us to pay for them in the first place.  You may have joked about it, but at the end of the day there was no real outcry.  No backlash.  Everyone just kinda said, ""Eh, whatcha gonna do?"", and that was a green light to keep doing it.  You laid back and took that abuse, and now it's all you get.

I told you so, but think of this as an opportunity.  Now you can see the lines that lead to these money grubbing schemes, and now you can stamp your foot down and say, ""No.  I will not buy a multiplayer-only game from a company that is becoming increasingly infamous for it's bugged out, broken games, some of which STILL aren't entirely patched.""  And before a single one of you says ""It's not multiplayer-only; you don't HAVE to play with other people if you don't want to"", yes it is, shut up, you're wrong.  You need a constant internet connection to play, which makes it online only.  Say ""enough is enough"".  Multiplayer doesn't make a series better.  Is Elder Scrolls Online the definite installment of that franchise?  HELL NO!  Skyrim is, and everyone knows it!  And at least that had other people besides horrible, terrible *real* people to talk to, so you knew you actually were in another world that had stuff happening in it.

PEOPLE!  Wake up!  You let this happen to EA.  You let this happen to Ubisoft.  Are you going to let it happen with Bethesda?  What's next, Nintendo?  Are we going to tell the game world's happy little actually-invested-in-beta-testing-to-a-mirror-polished-finish cherub, Nintendo, that it's okay to start with a slightly okay ""thing"" they stapled together out of scraps then and then charge us for ""more please"" and proceed to shovel bullshit into our waiting maws like good little baby birds, until the ""more please"" bullshit is all we're starting with???  Well I certainly didn't start saying that was okay, and I invite you to join me in saying just the opposite.

""I won't stand for this shit, and neither should you.""

PS  Guys, stop pre-ordering games.  That's 90% of the problem.  When you pay for something before it's even made what obligation do they have to put any effort into it at all?  ""$200"", they're not even finished, and now you get a hunk of plastic with a lightbulb in it you could have gotten as a Halloween mask, which will now sit on your shelf for the next three months before disappearing into the closet, and inevitably your storage unit.

But I do blame a very specific portion of the PC playerbase for the hubris Bethesda had when thinking this was a good idea. If this doesn't sound like you, then I'm not talking about you, and don't get all ""bawww don't generalize us, we're not all like that"" because I know; I'm talking about a very specific subset of PC players in this post and as someone who also plays PC sometimes (Morrowind and Fallout 3 were on Console, Oblivion and Skyrim were PC, and I haven't had the time or money to play the rest) I'd have to be an idiot to think all PC players are like what I'm about to describe; I know only some are.

In recent years - specifically the last two years since I actually was without a decent PC for gaming from 2011-2016 due to hardware issues - I've noticed a very vocal subset of players around games that have modding scenes. ""A negative review because the game doesn't even load? How fucking DARE you not expect to fix it yourself, you pussy consolefag plague on the industry! Stop ruining real games with your bitching and go choke on your mobile games!"" Whether it's the frankly unacceptable PC port of Jade Empire (it needs fan patches to even be playable in the second town of the game since the framerate drops to 1 since the engine itself craps out, even on a beastly rig that Jade Empire uses only 1% of the resources of) or a Bethesda game, there's a VERY noisy group out there that thinks the devs don't need to release a functional game; these people expect it to be on the average user to do it themselves.

You may wonder why I blame this specific subset, when surely a small raging group wouldn't be worth Bethesda's time? Well, imagine a substitute teacher in a classroom where two children are throwing tantrums. Even if the other 28 are complete angels, negative emotions have a stronger impact than positive ones, and those two problem students will be the ones that teacher remembers. Who's Bethesda more likely to really notice? The fans who are like ""We like your games and all, but you need to fix them"" or the rage-a-holics who go to war with anyone who thinks Bethesda needs to anything? The shrieks of one side overwhelm the reason of the other, despite the smaller numbers. Bethesda releases buggy messes because they don't think it matters due to fans fixing it for them, and current gen consoles having access to limited modding only makes it more apparent how lazy they're getting.

So in closing, remember this: You can mod the worst game in the world until it's the best game in the world, but it won't mean the original devs made anything good. Hold devs to a higher standard than ""fix it yourself, shitheads, we can't be bothered,"" ESPECIALLY in an online game where modding is either denied/restricted or can cause issues when one player loads in with gear no one else's computer knows how to interpret. If you keep defending companies like Bethesda, they'll release something the players CAN'T fix - like Fallout 76 - and you can see how that's going!",2018-12-09T01:08:39Z,0,0

The way they think is ""Since people will buy anything Bethesda makes why make a new engine. Don't fix what ain't broke."" So he introduces the idea of a Fallout Multiplayer game. The executives are practically drooling over the potential sales of an Online Fallout game they can just ravage. So they put together what we have now Fallout 76. Now Todd has his bigger team for his later projects. Now here's where the genius comes in. I think he knew that the game engine couldn't handle it. I think he knew the game would be a glitchy mess and that people would be up in arms about it. I think he planned this so that he could get the greenlight for Bethesda to start work on a new engine. If this theory is correct it explains a lot. I think Todd is sitting back and laughing as Bethesda is burning so he can rebuild it.",2018-12-08T22:04:48Z,0,0

The Survival mechanics are much better than in caseout 4. As a survival game, it is very appealing and the game is really fun to play with a friend. This game should not be run through in fast pase, this is a role playing game. Dont run around like chikens whitout any purpuse or imaginations. Fallout is for those whit great or little fantasy and imagination, combined whit game lore and whit tons of side mission you have a complete game full of  bugs butt the will fix that.

Reality: Starting your own games should tell you that this is the case. And only a few bugs? Are you kidding me? Your games have way more bugs then any other open world games I have played, having played your games since Daggerfall... and in all those years this has not changed.

I guess they are trying to be sustainable and find a stable source of cash. Since Multiplayer RPG and its competitive nature sure brings in the money due to many players playing and paying their way to the top.

I guess it could have worked. Only if they are ready to dedicate the work and effort required to create one. Great servers for multiplayer AND an amazing single player with a great stories.",2018-12-07T18:12:48Z,0,0

Enough to tolerate Bethesda beating up Black Isle and stealing it like its their lunch money. But they've been taking out the best parts one by one with each game.

You walk out on a perfect sunrise in the forests of Skyrim and the light flickers through the trees and the little stream bubbling in the background, or you gaze out over the beautiful panoramic display of the ruined wastelands, and think wistfully of the ruination of man.

Then what? Janky, bugged out mechanics, boring and formulaic dialogue, a gigantic worklist of quests, and zero intensity. Zero. Save every few minutes, death is meaningless, and your main quest's importance is ruined by the constant side quests so it just feels meaningless.

I'm pro-sandbox, but Bethesda just make directionless messes that bamboozle everyone with insanely good visuals. I've enjoyed my time in Fallout 3, 4 and Skyrim. I don't feel the need to return any time soon.",2018-12-07T17:00:44Z,0,0

Bethesda already has stated that they want fix the glitches you find. Just because your so spoiled with every other game doesnt mean you cant look at a game for the potential.

I haven't really stuck with the series since Fallout 3. I just didn't like the direction I could see it going. The classic Fallout games are where it's at, and unfortunately I think the brand has now been permanently damaged. It's going to take a firm and careful hand, and really clear direction, with the next Fallout game to really fix this. 

And ya know, that ending bit with micro-transactions... We gotta drop the ""micro"" part, honestly. When you spend 18 bucks on a paint scheme or five bucks on a hair style... That's not micro. You buy full fledged indie-games on STEAM for that price on a regular day. 

I think it would be totally fine for developers to offer custom skins or hair pieces for pennies on the dollar. A quarter. Something. But you should not be paying the cost of a full indie or budget game for a piece of fucking cosmetics...

And that's only the side, of course. With all these bugs and glitches, and obvious indications that things were not tested properly before release... Just save your money.",2018-12-06T20:00:40Z,0,0

I started playing since 3 and now they've managed to disappoint me twice with this game being shit as well. Great job Bethesda, you made the game that introduced me to post apocalyptic adventures  and destroyed it. I was really hyped that after 4 you'd be bringing out fallout 5, but now I am scared that you'll just go down a broken road that was layed by EA",2018-12-06T18:46:17Z,0,4

I am disappointed tho to find out after building a swamp house compact and decorated I come back next day to find my camp is gone and the building,

Edit: also disappointed that the price dropped so low so fast because I did not get any access to the beta I was told I would get for pre order and when it was out price was like half now so I could have just bought it when I could play it and it would have saved me a lot.

And you can never seem to form a party yet.

We asked for elder scrolls with friends. They gave us a mmo while The gaming community gave us like 12 versions of co-op. 

Bethesda is steadily going down the EA route and idk if I trust them to ever put money up early for a game again (Especially since we don’t have to anymore as we can digitally download the game and not have to stand outside GameStop overnight anymore).

Elder scrolls 6 is the last game I’ll give a serious look at, but if they mess that up as well I’m going to the stock market and bidding on their stock failing. ProjektRed might be the new wave for me.",2018-12-06T15:27:45Z,0,0

It’s becomes bad when it takes away from the customers. So they spent so little on the game and so little on the bag while overhyping the game (because thats free, the players do that most) and making it look good in advertising so people think it looks cool and buy a shit ton of copies. I don’t trust any game developer now because this is how it is now, the days of passionate people making a game for the sake of quality is over. Now it’s the corporate machine that took over, it can work sometimes because that provides more resources to make a higher quality game but it will always lead to shit like this where corporate says “yeah that sounds cool but what about the costs? Can you make XYZ cost less so we make more profit??? Thanks pumpkin I knew you would understand.” Throwing games out like Scalebound which looked amazing to me and it could’ve been such a good game. But no they want to make the same damn thing over again.

Notice how every single game that comes out looks like a movie trailer?? Yeah it’s becoming the movie business now, copy and paste things that work and make money and killing things that is innovative, imaginative, new, and unique because it’s too risky and too costly, Star Wars anyone?? Halo anyone?? Destiny anyone?? Gears of war anyone? COD anyone?? Come on might as well do it. its gonna come out no matter what because they’re making money off it. Eventually that’s all we’re gonna have in the gaming industry copy and pasted games.",2018-12-06T12:24:06Z,0,0

Sadly I cannot even grab things i could back in fallout lets see, newvegas, fallout 3, fallout 4, elderscrolls oblivion and elderscroll skyrim. What happen to that GRAB FEATURE ! that was soooo fun ! What did they Remove it ......grrr . Also Why is mellee so overpowered in this game ? Why is it more powerful than a sniper to the head or a shotgun to the face ! The powerarmor mellee builds = brainless idiots. Every single one of them = rush in take the kill thats it . This game is the birth of why raiders became raiders .

I haven't seen a positive review of it, and I watched a lot. For what I know, I think it can be fixed... With a lot work, but it's possible.
I think the only way to do a good multi-player shooter is copying Borderlands, it has a ton of side quests, a good story, and coop. Yes it's a linear story and decisions have no impact on the story, but even that can be done with some creativity... And no, I don't think a fallout should be like that, but I think it can take some things from it.",2018-12-06T02:49:17Z,0,1

It sounded like people were laughing pretty hard at the bugs in the game so at least it put a smile on your faces.  For Millennials they get to experience what real bugs are like for the first time.  They get caught up so much in their lighting, sunrays, and pop in hehe.  Of course, I am not interested in playing this game.  It has nothing to do with the bugs though.",2018-12-05T22:16:57Z,0,0

Remember in Fallout3, NV, and 4 clicking the VATS button and the game crashing? Ah nostalgia. I miss losing 30+ minutes of gaming because I didn't find a bed to save, losing my drops, and having to replay content I just did. 
Those games are still in that state. It's 2018 and they still freeze and break. It's funny because it's a single player game. I have been DCed less than I have in any other fallout game and I'm level 90 - and it's a multiplayer world. I think they're doing just fine.
People like to be romantics and act like their memory isn't flawed. Look up the study with the lady who was cognizant while being raped, and how she ""knew"" who raped her and wrongfully accused the same guy twice. So much for photographic memory huh?
The more people rip on 76, like this one ""OMG THEY TOOK FALLOUT 4 AND REMOVED ALL THE STORY FOR FETCH QUESTS: the more I look back at the older ones and I think: ""a settlement needs your help""; ""I need you to receive this beacon"" ""Go to the dead drop"" - LOL. NO SERIOUSLY GUYS THERE IS A FUCKING SETTLEMENT THAT NEEDS YOUR HELP! THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER! Fallout 4 had terrible NPCs, story, and was nothing but fetch quests. They dumbed down the system and perk cards are WAY more flexible. I can stack dromedary and cola nut so that 1 nuka cola hydrates me. I'm having fun.

Fallout 76 is RICH in potential!  i feel i just about got my moneys worth ofcourse they could have done better... however i would be willing to pay for DLCs, i hope they add further end game content, idealy games like these shouldent have a end game....
also looking forward to the private servers so we can have actuall modded games
what im worried about here is the irrational complaints about Fallout 76, people treat this is how Fallout games will be, like its fallout 5. but its not! its a multiplayer game spin off! should be gratefull they did this and have many plans for future expansions.

My friend bought it for me because he wanted friends to play with and he is a die hard Fallout fan.  He also pre-ordered the power armor edition.  He has, and is, trying really hard to like this game, so am I, but its just a mess.  The lack of NPCs, the stale main quest, and the worst part is being unable to interact with the quest objectives.  Bethesda was my second favorite developer after Bungie, but we all know what happened to them.  Then Bethesda did one of the owrst things which is add micro-transactions, and I'm willing to bet they are working on DLC at the same time they are trying to fix bugs and patch in assests for said DLC, which is why the patches seem to do nothing.  If they release DLC before fixing most of this game, I will not play any of their new releases until its been thoroughly reviewed.

You’re being sold early access games in reverse without being told. With regular early access games, you know it’s early access and you save money as the game is cheaper at that point and you get future content updates for free. With AAA gaming, you pay MORE for the early access AND you pay for the future content as they finish the game. You’re being scammed and you’re paying for the pleasure.

I've waited a little over a week now to watch your review to gain some more perspective first. This is one of my favorite reviews you've ever done. I agree with just about all of what you said, and I sincerely wish Bethesda would have delayed this game, or done a much, MUCH longer beta. I hope videos like yours, and all the backlash over this release, serve to ensure we don't have future releases like this from them. We all know they can do so much better.

That said, my justification for still enjoying FO76 would be the map. That ""rich kid's fancy sandbox full of shitty/broken toys"" goes a long way for some of us. No other open world game designs a map quite like a BGS game. It's the sheer quantity of unique locations, even the unmarked ones with shitty loot, each one seems to have some thought put into it (some just have silly/cool/interesting things to look at). I always notice the shortcuts other developers take to fill their worlds up, whether it be an over-reliance on prefabs, or an algorithm designed to randomly generate unique locations for them, it never feels quite as good to explore. Bethesda seems like they painstakingly design vast amounts of their maps with so much detail that you could spend dozens of hours on exploration alone.

Another way to describe FO76 for me would be like... a drawing made by a two-year-old, that a master artist then picks up and spends 40 hours coloring, texturing, and detailing. Yea the shape of the initial drawing would still look crude and messed up, but damn if there wouldn't still be a lot of cool shit to look at in the finer details. There's no excuse for the state this game is in, but I think even just having a BGS-designed map to explore makes it worth playing (though arguably not at $60).",2018-12-05T06:04:58Z,0,2

They actually built an entire MMO featuring all of their weakness and little to none of their strengths. They were never a company capable of this, and any of us who've spent a long enough time playing their games should have known better.

I’m sorry all of you who are going through developers like this Bullshit Artist, aka. Todd, saying “We listen to our fans feedback, and responded to them, because that’s what makes us better developers.”

Listen Here Todd! Get your fucking head out of your ass! You’re no Game Developer to me. You’re a greedy scam artist, that’s what you are. You are a FOOL if you believe the shit is coming out of your mouth thinking that it’s sincere. You Todd and your team are walking DISASTERS in the gaming industry. What an embarrassment!

Edit: I never in my live I feel angry at the quality and time and planning in what these kinds of developers are doing these days. Wow!",2018-12-05T04:02:06Z,0,0

But after I beat it on hardcore... the story just ends.. gripe but understandable, my disc tray was having problems opening for the last few years anyway and when I opened my console to correct the problem I reassembled it and got the 3 lights of death. I guess that; and me being oblivious to where games are going are a sign. Shit was good,.. might as well stick with rockstar and elder scrolls, because I know damn well they are going to keep elder scrolls legit; from this mistake. Thanks Joe.

To all those people who say, it isn't bad...if you play with friends. Sorry, you're in denial. It's pure crap. IGN gave this game 5/10...so you're not being an @ss...it actually backs your claims up. 

ESO same thing happen. constant band aids, making you buy upgrades....problem now with ESO, so many people got use to it they are blind to it anymore. People were buying them, most bc they didn't know better. So, bethesda did the same in FO76 thinking we would just spend money after buying the game...Cash grabbing B@st@ards!!!  ESO: If you complain about UI issues etc..""Oh it's your game system""...NO it's YOU BETHESDA!!! Yea, I reload UI  three times an hour in my other MMO's Bethesda...BS. ONLY on your games dude. 

So, I am not surprised. I actually loved Fall out series and the Elder scrolls and now...I refuse to buy them...Bethesda is going to have to show me they learned their lesson here, but I doubt they did. 

ASK EA how that went...Rockstar is laughing all the way to the bank...RDR2 is killing it and I love it. I hope Bethesda goes bust after this.

Heck even Sykrim or Fallout 4 are actually a mess and they never fixed the bugs. For crying out loud some of the bugs in the engine are from 2006 and not fixed. 
Guys… get real. Todd Howard literally said on the press conference that the made the same game over and over. And people still buy it, a lot.
There is even some good in there at least for Skyrim and Fallout 4: Mods.
But honestly having the community fix your ass broken game is a poor buisness model, at least for the consumer. Yet for some reason people let it pass… well you asked to be screwed doing that.

I blame Bethesda policy of keeping that GameBryo engine alive. Todd may claim that the “changed every module and its a brand new engine” but I call bullshit on his crap, he is just full of shit these days.
Its a rotten foundation, completely outdated and riddled with issues the haven’t fixed for around 15 years. Don’t expect them to fix them now...
They need something completely different, something new but it won’t happen. Why? Money.
Their staff knows their way around the established tools and they can therefore crank out new instalments with relative ease. They will be buggy messes but that hasn’t bothered the community before… again: You asked to be screwed at some point.

The joke is they actually have idTech…

1) Perksystem without respec - yeah, sounds like Joe has not paid much attentiont to most of the games in the fallout series- It has always been that way. it is supposed to be thought through before, building a character, same like Diablo2. Oh you're casual? Fuck it - that is really not hard to do and ""casualization"" is actually fucking up the pc gaming scene for years, together with consolegaming and politicial correctness.
2) colorful world - Fallout is supposed to be grey, brown and dark. It is a nuclear Wasteland, not fucking Azeroth. 

People are angry about that game? Completely undestandable, but why are people so surprised. It was steadily declining hard with Fo4. 
The old Fallout games were really geniune for their time.
Fallout3 was a surprisingly good adaption to firstperson.
Vegas was absolutely cool, and it was punishing in comparison to FO3.


For me and many others Fallout was in essence an exploring and survival game, with a dark and nostalgic athmosphere, which got lighten up by edgy humor. The gameplay mechanics were always a bit over ""casual"" level, at least in the old ones, and that was a good thing. A game from this series should always contain those aspects, even if you develope it as an MMO-clone. That means:

- AfterWar Athmosphere and Nostalgia
- Well written NPCs, that introduce you into the world and its rules, cause players cant give you that kind of a story, especially if you target a fucking fornite-kid audience
- Society in which you need to integrate, otherwise face consequences
- No Equipment-Restriction, you use what you can find and loot 
-  Punishing Encounters, especially if there are other real people around
- character planing and different playstyle to fight through the world and aquire goods
- No Bulletsponging, it is about killing, not ""knocking"" off Hitpoints, Encounters should always feel dangerous 
- Decisionmaking, beeing able to make changes to the world or NPCs, but also beeing able to loose stuff, getting Injuries, facing consequences of your choices

Most of those aspects were already not established in the least in FO4.
When they announced Fo76 I already knew the series is dead.",2018-12-04T22:05:55Z,0,0

However, Fallout 76 was fun, I got 50 hours into it with a viewer friend at least and I enjoyed every minute of it, because it was more of what I loved in Fallout 4... the combat.

Combat is what I liked in Fo4, everything else in that game was garbage from the story to the writing, the only thing I even liked story/writing wise was Nuka World and that's stretching it.

Fallout 4 was a failure of a Fallout game, but at least the combat and customization was top notch and that's just more of what 76 brings to the table.",2018-12-04T20:51:05Z,0,0

They would be dicks to make money off the game in the process, however what if Bethesda deliberately pumped out this absolute bag of wank to prove online is not the future for the Fallout/ES series.

THEY ONLY COLLECT LOOT AND GET KILLED or spend 5-20min collecting for 1-10min of action, it's a boring game with cheap graphics and mechanics, that is being praised even though any person given unreal engine and a already designed game could pop out an island, throw spawners on it, randomize weapon spawns and boom badda Bing you got the cheapest fucking billion dollars in your pocket, Like, I could practically make fortnite on time splitters :future perfect map building mode.

Go back to basics, you have strayed off the path and it is starting to become more and more, do or die.

Fear of them fucking up their future games started with Fallout 4 for me personally, the trend of caring less and less about the RPG elements and more and more about the mechanics of the game...

The updates have done a whole lot of good to the game and this game did teach us to managed resources instead of being a hoarder. It does lack story and npcs but besides that its an amazing game. Should do a review on how the game runs now,2018-12-04T16:18:06Z,0,0

But after going many years having released several games and those said games having the same bugs over and over, its fucking sad. This is a triple A company. They should be able to fix this shit. But they dont because ""LOL The fanbase will probably love it just leave it"". Its completely unprofessional. I can only imagine how terribly they treat the employees there. They probably stress them out and rush them so hard nothing turns out right. So you have a group of employees who have lost their shit and have thrown something together in a panic and hope it's good enough for them to keep their jobs. I don't understand why these big game companies need deadlines.


And this really makes me really worried for ES6. I've been so excited for it, and i know they probably aren't even working on it yet. But the thing is they don't want to change anything. They don't want to switch to a new game engine at all. They'll just keep using the creation engine because ""its gotten better."" Honestly, no it hasn't.

I would consider myself a true Fallout fan, when Bethesda took over I was nervous but fairly satisfied with FO3. Then Obsidian came a long with NV and crushed it, great FO game. FO4 however showed the direction the franchise was going, a limited story on rails that was only enjoyable when I modded it to be enjoyable. They took all the effort out of developing multiple story paths where your paths had paths within paths and simplified their programing, Tod Howard straight up confirmed that.

You people continue to shell out huge amounts of money for collectors editions, pre-orders and other bogus shit from gaming companies that are scummy and treat YOU, the consumer, like wallets. You get all hyped up and excited from these multi million dollar trailers they release; cause THEY know the ""TAKE MY MONEY"" morons like AngryJoe are gonna dish out hundreds of dollars for this garbage. You know why? Cause you KEEP falling for the same shit over and over again. They could release Fallout 77, Q1 of next year, and you ""Take my Money"" shills would be salivating over the trailers and garbage PR.

STOP buying from these companies. I haven't bought an EA game since Battlefield 2. I got a bad taste in my mouth from Battlefield 2142 demo, and they've released nothing but junk year after year. Start supporting companies that make good games. Stop wasting money on pre-orders and SE's, do your due diligence and wait for reviews from reputable sources; not from companies being paid by the publishers. Stop being mindless zombie fanboys for your beloved franchise that these suit wearing mfers are destroying by taking advantage of your fandom. MAKE them release quality games. The only way to do that is to close your wallet and stop supporting these publishers.",2018-12-04T06:07:11Z,0,0

But there are a lot of qualities if you stop being a spoiled child for a minute and observe the details in the game. How can you be so blind as to call the game ugly? It's beautiful, specially for an on-line game. Oh... So there is light coming out from a spot a little lower than it was supposed to? Oh, my God! Call the Pentagon. The game has a lot of bugs, wich I hope will be fixed, and has terrible players, like no doubt yourself, but there is so much to enjoy, and every angry nerd only seem to take joy in calling it trash. I wander trough an empty desolated world with a close friend by my side, and together we learn a little bit about those who where faced with the desolation of the atomic war step by step as we stop to notice details in the homes and buildings, and stop to listen and discuss a holotape we found near a corpse. After clearing a train junkyard, me and my pal stop to drink a nuka cola and take a picture from the highest point in the area, and that picture turns into my loading screen so I can remember my journey so far. Yesterday a listened to a tape of a woman who hid from the scorched in a closet, and got stuck there. I heard her journal as she slowly lost hope and the last of her energy, until she finnally was reduced to try and move her toes. I was touched by the suffering she endured, and I really felt like a survivor in land of pain. If you can't enjoy any of that, than I'm afraid your inner child has died, and I honestly don't know why are you playing games. To collect points? To check where every beam of light is comming from? Maybe just to make money from being a completely disqualified critic on the internet for children to stupdly admire.",2018-12-04T05:49:43Z,1,0

Ignore the trolls Joe, youve been honest, thats all that matters.  Did you hear Ron Perlman is getting surgery to change his voice so no one associates him with Fallout anymore.

I ignored all the hate pre release to decide for myself about F76.  Even got PA Edition.  But the proof is in the Perfectly Preserved Pie.  65% of enemy corpses despawn before a ranged stealth player gets the loot theyve earned.  Major waste of time and bullets.  Animals vanish that you hunt without you getting the meat for your hunger.

At first I thought Whitespring was haunted, robots crawling on their chests, objects flying about crazy like.  A Poltergeist?  Nope just your typical Todd Howard Soup of the Day.  PvP'ers with all the Enclave stuff claiming sections of Whitespring and ganking people four on 1 if you dare try to kill a Ghoul in ""their"" farming spot.  So much for a little drama.  Its leave or run out of stims from these gank squads.

My modest house vanishing every time there is a server thrown me out issue and Bethesda expecting me to pay in resources to put my house back down in exactly the same spot it shouldnt have vanished from.  Only once was someone else's camp in my spot.  Spending over 1000 caps in a day moving my camp over and over and never being able to place my small house down in any of these flat open areas.  Should refund the caps.  So no nice house for me.

Power armor that wont let you exit, preventing you from completing some quests that need you out of PA to use a terminal.  Bosses with quest items vanishing before you can loot forcing server hopping to actually finish your quest.  The Eye of Ra vanishing 3 times before I could finish the quest chain forcing me to go up into the mountains to retrieve over and over and the Garb of Mysteries refusing to be repaired and lets face it, by the time you are lev 25 to use it, its utter garbage compared even to leather armor.  Order of Mysteries ...FAIL

No Legendary hunting rifles in the game.  WTF.  So no TwoShot or Instigating for me ever and my TwoShot Dragon takes too long to reload.  Hopefully I get a TwoShot bolt action pipe rifle if I continue but honestly, there just isnt a weapon for me to look forward to finding.  So whats the point of the pathetic end game.

Danger warning bugged, sometimes for hours, travel 10 miles and its still danger but nothing attacks.  Scorchbeasts landing and attacking while it still says hidden or instantly detecting you while cameleon stealthed in a basement, are they Telepathic?  Maybe its the all seeing eye....

And whats with being hit several times per hour by nothing.  Did I sprain my ankle in Power Armor?  No real damage but makes you stop and search for enemies that arnt there.  And weight limit going down even though strength is not and theres no disease, mutation, addiction or debuff of any kind.  Fixed instantly by logging out then in.

And health going down constantly for no reason usually after Ive radaway'ed a lot of radiation.  Stims barely help and continues sometimes after logging out then in.  Ive played games more finished in early access.  Is that why you're afraid of Steam?

And how can I walk for 3 hours real time without seeing as much as a radsquirrel?  Ive scoffed in the past when people have called certain games a walking simulator but F76 really is.  Bethesda should try and sell this game to CD Projekt Red who care more for the fans than their bank account.  And my favourite thing Ive read online about 76.

Fallout 3 - Wheres my Dad?
Fallout 4 - Wheres my Son?
Fallout 76 - Wheres my refund?

K - Going back to Red Dead, Good luck guys - EB Games is giving me a refund today and cancelling Preorder for the Platinum guide :)  (shakes head)  And if any of you kiddies hears tick tick tickety on your common sense metres, pop some Radaway and start a Class Action to all get a refund together.

You cannot make that into a fun experience for everyone unless you make something akin to a party game (eg, Genital Jousting).  Also, no mods.

I did not want to get on  the band wagon of negativity, but after playing it for a hours the game is well pointless. There are good stuff, like the sound of the enemies, that had me worried, some music, the map was ok. I liked  getting the power armour early in the game, but the rest is well pointless. There is no point to the game, other than go round  to press a few buttons, enemies are all the same,  though it is great to get together with other players to take down super mutants, in gratton, but then that is all the same as it resets, oh and yeah items reset as well. Always  running out of space and weight limit is a pain, though i did like the fact you did not have  tags on enemies so they are hard  to see.

and who thought it was a good idea to turn a singleplayer bugfest game into an online multiplayer with no new game engine and work from the ground up. i played fallout 4 complete edition and it was a buggy mess..... Bethesda dude listen to me budds if for whatever reason u plan on making ur next elder scroll like fallout 4 or even like skyrim with only new graphics im warning you it would be the worst idea ever cuz Skyrim as great of a game it is playing it in 2018 feels so awkward and weird and the only reason ppl stay play it is the fan made mods and the fact that it was released in 2011 so dat makes the bugs ok but u REALLY and I MEAN REALLY need to up ur game with the next one no ones gonna buy another buggy game from u guys ure so behind in terms of gameplay and graphics development...(btw i'm only saying this as a huge fan of ur games)",2018-12-03T23:16:16Z,0,0

i am very poor irl on disability and it took 6 months of can collecting and doing things i cant even mention to  buy this i love fallout that much.   and it can take up to 3 hrs just to get in a fucking party with friends.  there is 0 pvp mostly ppl are helpful but about the time i take over something server crashes.  items randomly vanish i lost 58 power cores for NO reason .
i lost a full set of t60 NO reason. 

i get no loot on bomb raids cuz it cant load even with a beefy pc and great internet. this game is a fucking piece of shit.
      its SO bad  had i pirated it i would  wanted my time back. but now i stuck as i cant afford anything else its what i gotta deal with it,  fix the bugs it be fun but i dont see that happening. they are more worried about a arm being to long that the 2 fucking hrs it takes for me to get a party.+ everything is dark im legally blind  and when its night time fuck it even with a suit ""light""  u cant see jack shit unless its a bright light lord help you if you own x01 armor you cannot seem to find one. 

with out cheating or glitching i have made it lvl 120 +  but frankly  its dull  and my camp budget is a joke you ether have a place to live OR defenses ya cant have both, on top of that the only good water collector forces you by water only about 10 spots in the game to use it so better be ok with dirty or toxic water.  heaven help you if you get parasites + diphtheria  41 min of just staying in camp so you dont randomly die.

make a another video and this time be angry cuz FUCK THIS GAME.. stole my damn money huge fallout fan.. i feel cheated.",2018-12-03T22:15:35Z,0,0

I will NOT be purchasing this rubbish now, I appreciate the honest reviews you deliver.
Maybe, just maybe the Dev's will begin to listen to consumers once their profits begin to plummet.
It's safe to say that we're all sick of full price half ass cash grab attempts of games that only ever disappoint the gamer's.
Enough is enough, NO more EA games, Bethesda is falling, Activision/Blizzard is corrupted and greedy, don't even get me started on my beloved Bunjie,
ahhhhhhhh I feel sick, sick of being ripped off.
There needs to be a serious shift in the way these companies operate, it's time for Gamer's to wake up and send a loud and clear message to them with our wallets !

They have released the most boring game ever, skyrim, 4 times with little to value added, tried (and succeeded on xbox) to monetize mods and have consistently released buggy mess after buggy mess one after the other. Can anyone tell me about a SINGLE Early Access online open-world survival game that has survived longer than like 4 months with a 60 dollar pricetag that is THIS buggy? How come everyone else shits on the other games that actually try? How come super anti-consumer shit company Bethesda gets away with it?

Previously though it could be overlooked most the time because it was more fun than the bugs could take away. But this is the unholy cake that they have waiting to eat. BUILD A NEW ENGINE WITH ENTIRELY NEW ASSETS. Stop recycling this trash. I always want to like Bethesda games but the bugs always take just enough away from there games experience that it's not playable for me. It's not the players responsibility to fix the games...,2018-12-03T15:23:49Z,0,0

They also don't give a shit about making meaningful content and designing good combat and movement because they know that modders will also fix that. These games run mostly on mod support and nothing else. I was baffled that Fallout 4 got such good reviews when it came out.

I keep kicking myself for pre-ordering Evolve for the full price, but at the very least, Evolve had competent gameplay, stable graphics, and no game-breaking bugs (at least to my knowledge). But Fallout 76.....I mean, I can understand that Bethesda wants to branch out and expand their company, and a multiplayer Fallout game does sound fun, but this broken mess of a game should NOT be the end result of that wish. And I agree with Angry Joe; Bethesda is officially on probation.

They've been trying to do this for many years already.

Bethesda are also under fire for refusing refunds to players who downloaded the game, well now we know why it's not on Steam.

They might actually be the worst company I've ever seen now, it's very clear they aren't the Bethesda they used to be.

Is every games company corrupt now? Valves Artefact just released and it's pay to win... As if Valve doesn't have enough fucking money, it blows my mind.

As a mid 50's gamer, I've been playing FPS and Adventure games since their inception. I've played good, bad & ugly games. The bad and ugly are usually from low end developing studios.
Bethesda, you have really dropped the ball on this. 

Really, Micro-transactions............. They're fine with a Free-To-Play but to put them into such an under-developed, un-enjoyable, terribly performing, under-delivering, High budget game............................... Just not acceptable!
I own pretty much all of your Elder Scrolls and Fallout products. I have enjoyed them all to a larger or lesser degree.
I WANT TO KNOW WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LIES AND DELIBERATE MISLEADING STORIES DEFRAUDING LOYAL CUSTOMERS TO TRUST YOU UP FRONT? 
I believe 76 was marketed this way, because if it hit the market in the traditional manner, it would have never sold. Bethesda knew that!
THE PERSON OR TEAM GROUP THAT MADE THIS DECISION, NEED TO GO.
I WILL NOT BUY FALLOUT 5 OR ANY OTHER FUTURE BETHESDA GAMES UNTIL I SEE GREAT POSITIVE CONSENSUS ON REVIEWS.
If you do this lying, deceptive marketing again, Bethesda, will be finished, forever, with myself and my offspring.",2018-12-03T07:53:01Z,0,0

I didn't mind the bugs in the game and laughed a mostly all of the. I didn't mind getting to lvl 60 and having to totally remake my character spending 5 hours on what I wanted my build to be. The other lack of legendary drops, having to choose to farm gear or kill a glitched out flying dragon that you have a 70pct chance of dc'ing in the 15-30 min fight is what will kill this game. 

My voice will never be heard by Bethedsa but Thank you Joe for bringing it up so they might fix it. I've put over 200 hours in so far and I'm willing to far 500 more beliving this game will get better.",2018-12-03T05:33:24Z,0,0

Basically, I love Fallout. I've been a fan since 3, and though I had problems with 4, I still thoroughly enjoyed it. One of my favorite parts is the open-world and the lore, actual gameplay be damned. With that in mind, do you think I would enjoy this game?

Due to the 'canvas bags are too expensive' crap they pulled with the $200 release, Bethesda might run afoul of False Advertisement laws.  Not for the bullshit press events prior, that would be too reasonable, but due to this stupid idea to swap out the bags.  In some countries this could make a full refund from Bethesda possible, as they did not provide the product as advertised.  Just do NOT accept the 500 atom ($5) compensation they are offering, or they will argue this was a 'settlement' and easily win.  
Please ask a local lawyer to see if you can use this to your advantage, for a voice online can not give good legal advice.",2018-12-03T02:13:44Z,0,0

I had unsubscribed during the Battlefield 5 bullshit. That was the point where my patience had ran out. Stay away out of politics, Joe. You're out of touch, don't know what you're talking about, and pissing on your own community. That or you actually know what's up but are toeing the line for the sake of sheckles. Either way, you're wrong.

This, Joe, this 40 minute fuckfest of rage, criticism, and consumer advocacy... this is what made you great. This is what us old fans first subbed for.

Now, on to the subject itself...
Idk why anyone was shocked by this. I mean, yes, 76 is worse than I expected it to be. I expected 76 to be a bit messy and boring, but it turned out to be... holy shit, this mess... But, what I mean is, I don't get why anyone was excited for and thought this was going to be GOOD.

Who's behind this game? First and foremost? Bethesda. What's Bethesda known for? OFFLINE, SINGLE PLAYER games that are actually quite mediocre in a lot of ways, but have this unique magic in a bottle experience to them that sucks a player in so well that they can overlook its numerous and glaring faults. Bethesda's games are notoriously buggy and poorly polished; always have been. They are notorious for having a lot of half-baked shit in them; always have been. I could go on. But, again, they still have a particular magic in a bottle feeling to them. It's what's driven the modding community to stick with Bethesda games and go absolute apeshit pushing them to their limits. I'm currently 76 hours (oh, what a coincidence) into my Skyrim SE fresh playthrough with a load order of 150 mods. There is nothing, I mean NOTHING that I have ever played that can compare to my install of Skyrim SE. But why is it that good? Because, at the end of the day, what Bethesda is REALLY known for, is creating mediocre games that are the perfect sandbox and toolset for modders to fix, modify, expand, and personalize. I can't play Skyrim without mods. Just can't do it. Oblivion, too. They're both dreadful in comparison to what else in my library I could be playing. But with mods, as I said... nothing can compare. Interestingly enough, Morrowing.. that ancient relic... is the only one I can play without mods (except graphics mods; I use those regardless). And even Morrowind I use a few light mods on.

Point is, it's Bethesda... You should have seen this coming. Now lets move on to ZeniMax. Where do we know them from when it comes to online shit from Bethesda? Oh, that's right! FUCKING TES: ONLINE!!! Yeah, you remember that mess?

Bethesda + ZeniMax + FALLOUT 4!!!! + ONLINE!!! = WHAT DID YOU EXPECT????
As I said, I didn't expect it to be THIS bad... But I can't sympathize with anyone who actually expected this to be GOOD.",2018-12-03T02:01:43Z,0,0

I can't honestly call myself a fan of Fallout, I like the premise but I just never got into the game, but I do really love Elder Scrolls.

Should I just abandon all hope for ES6? Because from what I heard, Fall Out 4 wasn't great, ESO has been a consistent disappointment, and now there's this. I'm adult. I have a damn job. I don't have time or money to waste on bullshit.

I find little to no bugs (thankfully) ,no glitchy scorched beasts (never seen a scorched beast ever), and the servers rarely crash (except when they do) when there are bugs, it only lasts a few seconds (hours) is easy to fix, (snap the disc) and it doesn't make the game any harder. (Yeah sure) it's amazing that the frame rate is actually decent in a map that large in a multiplayer game (laughs in ironic) The game looks really good (when it isn't freaking out) and captures the setting of the game really well. also, you totally ignore the setting of the game (if there is one), the reason there are no human characters is that it is 20 years after the apocalypse after an epidemic that killed all humans (surprising right). I'm sorry, you find walking through an abandoned town avoiding all the story (that on holo tape) boring. another thing, you can just mute the players, you are just too lazy to press two buttons. the player base is really nice and respectful. by-the-by the reason there is a ""giant blur"" is that that's a giant cloud of smoke and ash. you literally go there in the main story that you very clearly didn't do. this is comment is a joke btw.",2018-12-03T00:06:48Z,4,0

Some mistakes which might be acceptable for an indie developer get no such excuse when sold as a full priced game by a major studio like Bethesda. That being said, if I'm willing to tolerate those flaws and still enjoy other games, then I can tolerate them here.

Now, I will 'defend' Fallout 76 in one way I haven't seen other people note. The games bizarre commitment to no human NPCs (there are NPCs, just no human ones) and missing dialogue trees seems like a huge problem. However, that's only if you're comparing Fallout 76 to New Vegas. I instead chose to compare it to Fallout 4, and frankly, the lack of NPCs and dialogue is only a very minor problem. Fallout 4 had a very mediocre story, the only good parts of it were the non-interactable scripted parts, like the logs in Vault 88, or Kellogs memories. Not being able to interact with NPCs is really just a sidestep to being able to interact with crappy NPCs.

Bethesda is terrible at telling a story where you have actual choice in it, but they're not bad at telling stories that happen regardless of your actions. I'd rather have Bethesda just hire someone who knows how to write a good story, but I knew that wasn't going to happen. So honestly, Bethesda just cutting their mediocre attempts at telling a story out of the game, to make room for parts of game-making they're good at, is not a bad thing.

I know, it's shallow praise. As is the praise for the rest of the game (except the Perk cards, which I really like). But that's how I've seen Bethesda for years now. Games that both leave me incredibly disappointed, and yet still enjoying them. So I don't feel my money is wasted. But I'm sure as hell not going to be unhappy if Bethesda is forced to evolve or die. I was fine with them where they were, but the loss of Bethesda studios is not going to ruin my gaming life. I'd rather take a gamble that they course correct rather than die.",2018-12-02T21:34:38Z,0,0

People buy their shit thinking it's going to be great when they want to screw you, or buy DLC because people apparently have the urge to throw away money for stuff that 10 years ago was in the base game but now removed for $$$$.
  
If you want Bethesda to get better, don't fucking buy their game, there's no worse ""punishment"" for a gaming company that their game is a selling failure, this way they'll understand you don't buy garbage and you, the customer deserve respect!
 But if you give them 200$ and expect it's going to be better it's useless, it solves nothing, STOP BUYING THEIR GAMES; LIKE EA!!!

It's as if you were going to a restaraunt that over time has been serving meals that got shittier and expensive as time went on and every week you eat there you expect it to get better when you get out with even less money and not satisfied. 
I've stopped buying games (especially anything from EA) because of the microtransations bullshit, this way i'm telling them that i don't tolerate that shit in a game.

Never in a million years would I have ever thought a company like Bethesda would do something absolutely unacceptable like this. It's like if you grew up loving a parent , just to find out when you're 18 that they're serial killers or some shit. Not even singular game developers that have a 9-5 job do as terrible a job as this. Until Bethesda acknowledges how shitty this game is and promptly starts a community wide fixing of the problem, I will not give them a single dollar for anything whatsoever. Worse than EA at this point. I remember when their twitch stream reveal first came up, I immediately thought that it was gonna be a Fallout 3 remake that would drop on the ten year anniversary.

I was gonna consider this but this game is just laziness from bethesda IF THEY MAKE AN ELDER SCROLLS 6 THEY BETTER HIT IT OUTTA THE PARK TO BE WORTHY OF 60 DOLLARS because this game looks like a piss poor and killing deathclaws with ease is a literal what the hell deathclaws are supposed to rip you apart like a piece of paper as if your nothing and provide a challenge all the creatures in this game the ones who are supposed to be strong are weakened is just why just why I know now im not gonna purchase this game for my ps4.,2018-12-02T17:38:48Z,0,0

How so, well Bethesda publishing, which Todd is the face for, is just that, the publisher, it's just like EA or Activision. Bethesda Game Studios is reponsible for making every numbered elder scrolls and fallout game (as in 1,2,.. 4,5, etc.) so Fallout New Vegas wasn't made by them, it was made by Obsidian studios, and published by Bethesda. Same goes for ESO and Fallout 76, reason being, Fallout 76 was primarily handled by the Austin branch. Which once upon a time was a different game studio, their game didn't work out and so became part of Bethesda. They had no experience with the creation engine, and were given a short time-frame, they tried to rip it apart and put it back together in a way that they assumed would work well for multiplayer. Suffice to say, that ended up being a very bad idea. 

This is why this game is so bad, yes Bethesda games are buggy, but it's not the engine's fault, even with a dated engine, you can still make a top-notch game. The problem lies in those that work on it, reason being, a game can range from running smooth as silk, to rough and buggy as hell. If you spend more time bug-fixing and tweaking things then you get a better game. Even after release every true Bethesda game has had bugs, but also patches and updates that fix them (or put them back in if the people ask for it, like Skyrim's space program via giants). Sure they don't get all the bugs, but what they don't get, the modding community does (and obviously modders must use the same engine as it's the game's engine, so the engine really isn't the problem). So improving the engine or making a new one may help, but ultimately it falls down to what you do with the engine. Bethesda Game Studios makes good games using their engine, the Austin branch failed badly. I never experienced some of the bugs others had faced in Skyrim or Fallout 4, obviously without the community patch, but there's plenty I did. Either way this game is a mess.

Now we know why it's this way, they (being the Austin branch) obviously didn't have enough experience with the engine, and not enough time to make this. Does that make this anymore acceptable, no, it doesn't. It just tells us what went wrong, and makes us more understanding, but something is still very much wrong. As such it's a bad game, it's still a game, you can still enjoy it, but it's unlikely. I still have high hopes for any true Bethesda game, but any game which is made primarily by one of the separate branches, is another story. This is gonna be a blemish on Bethesda's otherwise decent record, even if it's not the actual primary studio that did this, it still stings.",2018-12-02T17:09:28Z,0,0

And its getting worse each year I think. They need to take their time to make a good game. You can't just rush it and say ""will just fix it later"". You lose so many fans at the start of a games release and that just makes a domino affect were the rest trust the opinion of those who bought it first and then they decide "" If my friend/reviewer say its that bad ill just spend my 60$ in another game""",2018-12-02T16:42:39Z,0,0

Amazing to see the patronage afforded to a company that has no respect for gamers and treats them like idiots that eat shit and smile. They expect you to pay for garbage and like it like morons and have zero respect for your time and patronage. Just because Bethesda has zero legal obligation to provide you with a working product at full retail price does not mean they should act like drug dealers and con-men.

If you hold Bethesda to real professional standards, this is a hilarious joke that should be walked away from and shamed until it dissolves. Imagine if a smartphone company produced a phone as defective as this game is. Nobody would put up with that crap but most are happy to eat Bethesda crap off the same game engine for decades while smiling :)

I quit Bethesda at Fallout 3/Skyrim and dont miss the disappointment, none of my friends play Fallout 4 or this 76 crap so im not missing anything apparently haha. If you have any hope for the newest titles from Bethesda then you must be a masochist.",2018-12-02T16:31:44Z,0,0

If everyone that bought the game did the above, guarantee it would be corrected in under a year.

Bonus: Be sure to write/call in to their customer support. Not only does this reinforce the point, but also ups their Running costs so their finance department sees it as an issue and will elevate it in their management meetings.",2018-12-02T16:24:01Z,0,0

Skyrim and FO4 had very lackluster character dialogue and were far too linear to be called ""Adventure"" games. We need to be left in the dark on certain details in quests; given a reason to explore, not constantly be guided down narrow dungeons and questlines. Then there's the recent money grubbing with the paid mods and 76.
Bethseda has lost all interest in making exciting adventure games. They just want to funnel us through linear gameplays and bore us enough to make buying mods a must in order to add some diversity to the experience. 
To be fair, though, Skyrim did keep me for a good while. I mastered the shit out of it, but then I went back and played Oblivion again on a whim, and realized just how lacking Skyrim is by comparison. ESPECIALLY the Shivering Isles DLC in Oblivion. That DLC is the pinnacle of what all DLC in games should aspire to be, and I would play that DLC alone above Skyrim, FO4, and 76: none of them come close to its quality in design, writing, and as just an amazing experience.",2018-12-02T15:05:46Z,0,0

Sad to say, based on points and subjects discussed. this is without a Doubt an INTENTIONAL PLAN OF BETHESDA,  and here are my theories based on my conclusion
1. STOCK VALUE, SHARED PROFIT, AND ABUSE OF MARKET: certainly bethesda has prepared with how horrible the game would be with an insufficient amount of budget to the entire game. a copy paste version of fallout 4 will be very cheap tag along those lazy textures and crappy visual bugs everywhere therefore the entire project will be more profitable for stock buyers of Bethesda with so much hype  from the fans. giving us consumers a lot of false hype with their false promises of the game being better than the rest. if you know how these profit market abuse works, then you mightve gotten the idea already",2018-12-02T15:00:25Z,0,0

They are working on the game and you have to understand that it's not easy to make a game this into a solo story into a MMORPG

You talk trash about him saying ""NEW"" Lightning rendering and landscape. New means that this is a work in progress.

You are just a band wagon. The game is buggy but this Is a work in progress  with millions of hours of devolvement (it started being developed when fallout 4 did)

Just look at how long in between release dates the past Elder Scroll and Fallout games have.

Now look at all your Xbox and PlayStation games. Sorry but your hardware is outdated next to gaming PCs.

Finally a youtube video telling them like it is. We should all sue them. A class action sue where they are obligated to refund the money they stole from us. That would teach them not to release an unfinished game ever. After this, no more titles from Bethesda for me. Got my copy from Game Stop but managed to reseal it and refund it, then bought a discounted copy from Best Buy which I am assured I can return up to January 12 even if it is opened but if I am not, will be trading my copy towards Just Cause 4. Of course it would probably be worth nothing because the prices keep dropping as we speak; it won't be long until this game hits $20.00 mark. I do not even care for Bethesda to fix it any more. Damage is done and that is on them. Fuck Bethesda and all who participated in this big disappointment! Dude, you are not a troll at all; those kids hammering you for this review are just that; kids; I can not think of anyone who works for their money condoning such an atrocity like this game! we ALL wanted this game to be good, we waited for it and we were laughed at; there is no way those people in Bethesda don't know what they were doing in releasing a fucked up product and I hope they get the worst from consumer laws and reviews. When you do not respect your customers like this, do not deserve to have a business. Hope they all go to hell for what they did, or better yet for what they did not do, which was to provide a quality product. ---  Hey just wondering how you got Charlie Sheen to be in the video????",2018-12-02T11:15:13Z,0,0

Fallout 76 is Bethesda's first true MMO game made in-house.
Bethesda is known for bloody buggy as hell releases, with most bugs still being around months afterward. (Hell, New Vegas STILL has some game-breaking bugs.)
Fallout 76 is an MMO games. MMO games are known to use beta testers to make sure the game is actually working.
Fallout 76's cash shop that you complained about? None of it actually affects the game beyond making you and your guns look cool. Nothing else.
They legit said there'll be no NPCs.

Did they promise that the game wouldn't be buggy on release? Yes, but they had a too short public beta phase. (Most MMO games have a 1~2 YEAR long Beta phase before release.)
The only legitimate issue that exists with the game is that. Everything else is Bethesda being Bethesda. Get the fucking hell over it. It's their first in-house MMO, the next one might be better. But there won't be a next one if people keep complaining about Bethesda being Bethesda.",2018-12-02T04:21:58Z,0,0

To make things worst they allowed mods to fix these issues in fallout 4 so why didn't they just hire the people who fixed them to fix the fallout 76 issues? If they can port the bugs from the previous game then they can port the patch that the community has made to fix it.

Overall I enjoy it, still playing with friends and having fun but its not worth full price hands down. Its a rushed money grab game",2018-12-02T03:18:20Z,0,0

However, the game is exactly how I thought it would be. Its a Fallout world that's multiplayer and has no human NPCs, after hearing that I assumed it would just be a fun game to explore a post apocalyptic world with friends. I did NOT expect a great story/campaign being that there are NO HUMAN NPCs, I also did NOT expect the game to be any less buggy than previous Bethesda games (you haven't experienced Bethesda until you experience some hilarious bugs). All I'm saying is maybe wait until the game is released before spending $60+ on it, especially considering everyone was a little skeptical about this game since it was announced. I'm not necessarily defending the game, just recommending everyone do their research before buying a game, seems a lot of games of late have been falling short of expectations.",2018-12-01T23:49:51Z,0,0

At least with Sonic 06 or Big Rigs, you can atleast laugh at how absurdly broken they were and get some ""So bad it's good"" enjoyment out of it! This game is more or less a $60.00 broken promise! This looks like a Steam Greenlight with a beefed up budget! And Bethesda shipped this out in this state?! I would expect this sort of crap from EA, or Digital Homicide! It would be like if Rockstar announced Grand Theft Auto VI, and the finished product looked like Ride to Hell Retribution! If any other company had the AUDACITY to sell a game this Eighted-assed at FULL PRICE I would probably have the same reaction!(IN FACT, I'M GLAD THIS GAME DOESN'T HAVE A SWITCH PORT!)
