Back when BF3 was released most of the people who played BF1942/V/2/2142 were utterly dissapointed because the ""CallOfDuty'fication"" had finally reached Battlefield with BF3. (EA's CEO even said at E3 that BF3's goal is to destroy CoD)....

Guess what those who loved  BF1942/V/2/2142 said back then? _""Does BF really have to attract that other type of player to be successful?""_
So EA is just pushing it even further now with BF2042 and those who cherished BF3/4 now understand what we, the core Refractor Engine BAttlefield veterans felt when BF3 came out - which in fact DRAMATICALLY dumbed down the franchise and REDUCED the teamwork on publics.",2021-12-09T12:04:00Z,0,2

The Beta was an absolute meme for performance however I finally decided to boot this up and see what's what. System is an I7 11700k @ 5.1Ghz, 32gb DDR4 @ 3600Mhz, RTX 3070 and m.2 NVMe SSD's. Monitor G5 Samsung Odyssey 34"" 1440P. Graphics set to ultra w/ DLSS set to Balanced (RTX off because it's a meme in general) was averaging 120fps+ with monitor refresh rate locked at 144mhz. Dipped a few times to about 100fps but never experience any stuttering or tearing. The game itself still feels janky, I hate how the tanks feel to drive and the blimpishness of the choppers is hilarious (hitting them with tank shells is almost too easy). The class system is a complete and utter joke and seriously needs to get in the bin. Gameplay however actually feels smooth and a bit more solid from the beta. Hit reg ""sound feedback"" has been toned down from the beta which is good and the nerfed slide mechanic also a bonus. The severe lack of hardware (guns, attachments, rocket launchers etc) is most definitely noticeable, holy hell it feels bare-bones. The interface is dogshit and the colour scheme chosen is offensive, as you said, seriously, is that item checked or unchecked in the menu?! WHAT IS THIS!

Think this game will be going on the backburner for a while and I'll be sticking with my BC2 server and BF4 for the time being until this shit is fixed. It was a good distraction for a little while however they've got some SERIOUS work to do. This is the part where EA (and especially their execs and that dickhead who came across from Activision) need to take an extended vacation (like to a Siberian wasteland) and let DICE work it's magic on fixing this shit show (ALA BF4). However it'll be extremely hard to polish a turd.",2021-11-25T04:12:11Z,0,0

I got steady fps, no bugs (yet), and overall enjoyable gameplay, as the guns feels much better than in Halo (no Bungie magic for this one).

When I got used to the graphical style, I finde it beautiful and atmopheric.
But they lack more specialists, uniforms, weapons and mods.
Portal mode can help with the last.

And tbh, I got the game for free, but I think the ultimate edition with seasonpass should cost no more than 50$‚Ä¶

So say the combat feels dated, with no lean or ‚Äúparkour‚Äù, probably, but I haven‚Äôt been spoiled by these features as my journey stopped around BF4.
So for me it is just a solid BF feel.
Would I recommend it? For my own experience yes.

also when it comes to helicopters they are far from invincible if you have a stinger i have had more helicoper and jet kills than i have gun kills and the major problem i have seen with the new maps is they are so large you will tend to only be in one place so you dont have these massive all out battle but instead multiple smaller skirmishes at the different sectors and the occasional zerg of players steamrolling areas",2021-11-20T13:53:15Z,0,0

I really like your presentation and the effort you put into your reviews. Even if i strongly disagree with your opinions on some of them they are still great to watch. I find Battlefield 2042 a very frustrating game to see torn apart by people because after putting in countless hours since EA launch.... after refunding and then re-buying... me and my friends love the game. Everyone i meet in game seems to enjoy it as well. Once everything starts to click it feels like on of the best and most spectacular entries into the series. Its interesting how the reddit crowd and youtube have decided to write the game off when everyone playing the game seems to be having a great time. As with all battlefield games its rough at launch and will no doubt continue to improve over time  but honestly what we have at launch is fantastic fun.

So my un guided and I no way tech or network coherent guess is how they have your computer interact between the server and other people's machines. Perhaps there's an absurd amount of client side info that the server throws at your pc and tells it to ""figure it out"" before it's required to send it back so it takes from performance for speed In info processing. As far as I know if it was more server reliant it could run better but I'm not pc coherent, network coherent or in anyway know how computer specs change how it processes, reads or modifies data as need be.

I can't even say I'm surprised  at the state of this game anymore. Video game companies are all shit and nowadays they know you're gonna pay for whatever they put in front of you so they feel no incentive to actually try to make a good game. I saw plenty of coverage for this game earlier on in its development and I am deadass when I say if they took another year on it I'm sure it would be somewhat worthwhile to play. The sad thing is these game companies feel obligated to make new games every single year and that leads them to either remake the same game over and over or just push out some half baked piece of shit for people to poke with a stick. Either take more time to develop games, or don't make them at all in my own opinion.

If this game were called something other than BF maybe it'd be just fine, but what they've done with the movement and heroes especially makes it no longer a BF. I love the 128 player concept but the map design is terrible, full of marathons and no action between points, reduced to a few areas of conflict. The weapons really aren't anything to write home about (something BF was always known for), at least there's only 22 of them to be disappointed in. 

Anyone who thinks Portal is going to be either worth buying the game for or will save this game is kidding themselves. I turned off xplay and was left with only a handful of populated servers (that weren't farming) and only 1 was full. The rest had maybe a dozen or so people in them. Like rush? Hope you like those 2 maps from BC2 and are OK with playing them over and over. Like progression? That's not a thing in portal. 

All the guns in the main mode are locked behind levels, gone are the days of using a specific kit from a class and unlocking that way. Want to see what your squad is carrying? Nope, good luck getting them to type bac to you. No All chat so can't say anything to other team. Want to check score board? Nope, not in the game. Your squad suck and you wanna switch? Can't. At least we can super sprint (terrible)?

The new hero system has spawned lone wolf gameplay in a way I've not seen in this series yet. I've yet to have my squad stick together to go for an objective. As soon as they spawn they just go their own direction to do their own thing. I do get revived (when not bugged) by randos on the team so I guess that's nice. Only about 5 classes are played right now: the 2 medics, hacker guy, grapple hook dude, and now that people are getting lvl 35+ wallhack lady. The guy with shield had his shield disabled within the first few hours of launch. Oh, I guess people are using wingsuit squirlkin girl too sometimes. 

Overall this game isn't a love letter to BF fans going back to their roots, it's an unashamed cash grab from the uninitiated. The blatant copying of Apex/CoD mechanics and the new twitch shooter feeling go against everything that was BF. BF was set apart by pushing forward in a more strategic way and needing to work with your squad/team to get objectives done. Now it's just a bunch of lone wolves doing their own thing. 

I've not played HZ because I don't like battle royales (sorry, squad royales). This game is severely underwhelming at best. While it is playable (usually) it's just not worth it. Maybe at 75% off but it's a fraction of the game it should be. I would give it a 4 because it is playable but as a BF game it utterly fails. If you do play it (I suggest xbox game pass for $1/month for 10 hrs of ea play, or EA Play pro for $15 once [be sure to cancel it] so you don't gamble $60+) then you'll see how utterly devoid the game is and how surface deep everything is. A handfull of maps on a couple of game modes and a token portal mode they hoped would save their game. It's not good.",2021-11-17T13:22:28Z,0,0

The movement and general vibe of the game is off, Specialists don't gel well with the Battlefield formula, the UI looks weird. It's such a shame, because I think we were all expecting something like Battlefield 4 but with fixes to BF4's flaws. Less restrictive classes, making it harder to vehicle whore, making it easier to deal with KD farming vehicles. Sure, 2042 does have answers to these, but it also just feels like those changes came at the cost of the game's soul. Maybe they'll fix it, but to me it feels like some of these problems are too fundamental to 2042 to ever truly be fixed. There's still some fun to be had, but man...

It just doesn't look like Battlefield anymore. The removal of classes removes teamwork. Also I don't understand why bases appear to have been removed. 

I fondly remember BF3 watching all the vehicles roll out as a cohort. I'm talking about physically seeing the vehicles and jumping in them not vehicles spawning from the menu. 

Why does battlefield have to betray everything it once was in a time where so many games have become clones of each other?

It saddens me to see but at least the likes of Squad and Post Scriptum still provide that Battlefield feel that it seems Battlefield itself can no longer provide.",2021-11-17T01:00:43Z,0,0

For all the reasons mentioned. I think it destroys team play and balance in favor of immersion-breaking gimmicks that feel like they are stolen from Apex, Overwatch and CoD. It just feels silly and plays like a chaotic mess and that's no fun. I knew specialists existed but I didn't realize it replaced classes entirely until I picked up the beta. Personally, I would like specialists done away with entirely. But I realize with all the time put into coming up with them that won't happen. The next best thing is that they be like a battlefield pick up or some sort of point-earned call in. In either case only a limited number of people on a team could use a specialist at once, and once they die they lose it until they can earn it or find it again. Maybe that could actually happen, though I doubt it. But it's more likely than them disappearing entirely. In any event, I won't be buying this BF at launch which will be the first time since I started with the franchise. I'll play Hell Let Loose instead.",2021-11-16T19:40:32Z,0,0

32GB RAM DDR4 3200MHz CL16
1000W PSU
on a 2TB NVME

Game is being ran on a 5120x1440p monitor (odyssey G9), which means it's about 10% easier to run than 4k. It runs fantastic... On all max settings, RTX off (its an FPS, always off, only on for campaign games), DLSS set to ""quality"", I am getting 80-120FPS during gameplay and in fights (in all out warfare). That is better performance than most modern day games give in my experience.

Maps don‚Äôt feel very good or well balanced for breakthrough (little cover) and are frankly too big for conquest, even with 120 players it feels empty. That‚Äôs if it is actually 120, it doesn‚Äôt seem to tell you and has a lot of bots. 

Along with few maps and very very few weapons available, absolutely laughable in comparison to other battlefields. Hit reg looks dodgy, movement feels more like cod, odd HUD and UI choices like why no scoreboard or death counter? Change squads?

Specialists are stupid and ruin immersion. With clear balancing issues and redundant choices. Should of stuck with classes. These specialists are clearly just a ploy to sell skins and a thinly veiled excuse for lack of a story mode in attempt to have characterisation told though the multiplayer, which rarely works and is lazy.
That‚Äôs not even including the sheer amount of bugs I‚Äôve seen. That being said portal has potential and with enough care from dice could be really good for the series going forward.
Yes I know it‚Äôs all well and good saying this when I haven‚Äôt even purchased the game, but I as a potential customer are entitled to researching the products before I buy. And my research and experience with the beta is telling me to not buy this game in its current state. Halo infinite multiplayer just dropped today and that‚Äôs free, to me that‚Äôs a better option to invest time in until this game is sorted",2021-11-15T19:43:51Z,0,0

I was really hoping this would be a return to form for Battlefield. It certainly looked that way in the build-up. I played the BETA, which was okay, but the full game just left me cold.

The Hourglass 'training level' you could play while it was still installing was the worst first experience they could have done. The level looked basic, even on Ultra is looked amateurish in design - nothing fun about it at all, they should have left that out, already soured my opinion right from the start.

Speaking of graphics, I didn't really see a huge visual quality difference between Ultra and low also, which gave me a whole 'ported from console' feel to the game, I wonder if they started with consoles first then ported it.

LOTS of missing settings / quality of life settings all over the place, it's like they just ignored all of the perfected workflows in previous titles.

LOTS of bugs, the worst being the hit marker registration, it's AWFUL.

Whole game has an unfinished feel to it. I know it is early in the game, but I can only comment on what they gave us.

Everything feels a little spongey and soft too, weapon animations, the speed at which you run, even down to menu transitions - time to get in-game, it feels like everything needs tightening up, it doesn't feel like Battlefield to me - it felt more like a console version of Battlefield that wants to be Call of Duty but can't outright copy them.

But there were many areas in the maps that felt so underwhelming to me, the designs were generic feeling, no genius map design for sure. It's hard to describe, but it feels like an OLD game, not a new one.

The weapon modding mechanism is INFURIATING to use, COD Warzone absolutely destroys 2042 in this regard.

Now let's talk about the 'game'. This whole Ex-Pats thing is just lame. While climate change is real, I don't want to be depressed in a game about it. I just don't care about this whole Ex-Pats story, I mean, what's the point if you're not going to have a single-player campaign about it? Just feels like it was written by some inexperienced Millennial or Gen-Z graduate doing their first game, it's, just, lame.

Many of the character models also looked amateur, nothing memorable about them at all, just generic. Their animations are comedic. Their don't feel like gritty battle hardened characters, most look more at home serving you in Starbucks.

And let's not talk about the cringey after game report comments they make, I felt embarrassed to be playing the game when that came up.

The weather effects (because it's Climate Change yo) are just a gimmick. I can see people seeking out Portal versions of their favorite maps with those turned off.

Speaking of Portal, this is possibly the best part of BF2042. It was fun re-playing the classic maps, this was the one redeeming feature of the release, but not enough for me to keep it.

I may take another look months down the road, see if they've improved any of this. But for now, this isn't a slick, brand new feeling AAA Battlefield title, it feels out of date already.

Since as far back as Fallout..... games have launched broken.
Then it seemed with the trend of more powerful consoles and PC's, the ease with which people can pre order digital copies.... more and more...... and more morons pay HUNDREDS for a game, just to play it early, then cry like a bitch that it is broken.
Take Forza Horizon 5.
I love that game..... I waited and got it on Game Pass.
Yet, people paid over ¬£60 to get it early and what did they find? Constantly kicked from playing online....... still does it now.
Ghost Recon launched broken as hell..... Cyberpunk released broken as hell.
When the Series X and PS5 dropped last year, CoD released broken as hell and was bricking console's.
The new CoD Vanguard is a bloody mess.
Gaming, or the quality of games being made has gone down hill massively.
Yet you retards STILL get a sniff of a new title, and lose your minds.
You see a little more on the title and a Beta.... and you lose your minds again.
People make videos hyping up the game..... then people spend upwards of ¬£90 on an early access version of a game you know NOTHING ABOUT, then when it releases broken, you take to Twitter and YT crying about it???
With BF it is even worse! BF4's launch was a joke!!! Cast your minds back too the clusterf#@k that was BF4, and i am amazed it became the legendary game it is.
BF1 was an awful buggy mess, crashing PS4 Pro's PC's.... no sound, no hit markers.
BFV was just crap..... better now, but was bloody rancid.
Then BF2042......... it has gone and done a Cyberpunk, and people are shocked?
Either gamer's and streamers are thick as pig shit, or just gullible.
The industry will only change when you morons stop blindly Pre ordering games, parting with YOUR money and becoming 12 week Beta testers for the rest of us.",2021-11-15T16:20:43Z,0,0

As a hard core  BFBC2/BF3 and BF4 player ( i played but did not enjoy BF1 and BF5), would summarize this first week of pre-order/EA play as essentially a real beta test and we're seeing what i'd expect from a real beta. The official ""beta"" was really an early alpha test. I am enjoying the game quite a bit but admittedly I'm a big Battlefielder and I am also always playing with a 4 man squad of longtime friends & BF3/BF4 clan mates. THat means that i am still having fun amidst the myriad of issues. I am telling everyone i know that i'm enjoying the game but advising that they should hold off till things stabilize. Rubberbanding can get really bad at times during conquest matches. Sometimes we would spawn into maps with no kits available and no weapon attachments were unlocked. We also encountered matches where we were unable to deploy into the game. At least 2 times we selected breakthrough on the new maps but got thrown into portal matches (twice on Arica Harbor). the ""deploy"" selection options were a nightmare...my success rate for deploying either on a teammate or flag was 50%. They need to better highlight who you're spawning on. They need to disable the friends footsteps or tone them down. There is more. Fun game but lots to get worked, definitely not a launch purchase. If this is like Bf4, it'll take DICE about 6 months to get things ironed out and then it'll be a good purchase.",2021-11-15T15:42:57Z,0,6

I felt like I was having to put entire clip into enemies to get any response. With all the players on my team, it just added more confusion as I felt everyone was doing their own thing. 
Graphics wise, playing on a R5 2600/1070ti/16gb, I had to play on medium to get a good framerate, at that everthing seemed like a blurry mess, there are games that are 5yrs old that look/run better.

But I think while the game launches in a good state and the most important thing you can enjoy it, the companies deserves to launch the game, get the feedback and later do the right changes for a better game in future. 

In 2021 the people do not agree in anything, we can't wish a game with 50 remaster maps, modes with specialist and without specialist, btf 3-4-1-5 bc2, 1942-2142-  free to play, portal, hazard zone, battle royale, 0 bugs, men ...

Gun play feels  not engaging.
1: Audio Sounds very subdued and muddy.  This causes no directional information is communicated and feel of intense fight is gone.
Sharp bullets firing sound and painful bullets landing on target sounds are gone.  Wide war stage audio is not there.  All effects clips are recorded bit muddy. not good.
2: Game modes.  PUBG & Tarkov & R6 & Warzone have very intense thrill for survival: here in 2042 there is no engaging moment for survival.  thrill of chase for target nor struggle for survival is bit gone.  Free for all or Battle ROYAL or r6 type of mode may help
3: Character animations are not  detailed enough to present engaging  gun fight scene: running and dodging sliding jumping over and falling down to ground.  They look awkward compared to other shooters.
the above makes less involving & engaging shooter.  Maps are wide this  makes me feel of war not close q combat but when I face enemy shooter for CQB the above 3 makes the fight very bad

Also annoying is hearing them speak every single ‚à´ucking time when they refuse revives. Just be quiet and go to sleep already. BFV voice-acting was absolutely passionate and situationally necessary. Beta was good. Trial was bad. Uninstalled after 3 hours of laborious gameplay. Save $70 but avoiding Vantard too.

And by then the video card makers will have their next...next gen cards out which shouldn't have any problems running this game at 4k, max settings, at very high frame rates.  I think the 3000 nvidia series and the amd 6000 series just don't have enough juice to run these games at the levels needed.  Oh, and let's not forget current and next years CPUs.  Hopefully in a year the chip crisis will finally be over.

Live service brought a lot of bad to gaming as well. You would think they would continue to make content packed products and expand them post launch instead of stripping all of it away and release them unfinished and barebones.

I don't understand how DICE made a game that took a big step away from the classic 64 player flow and gameplay AND introduced Specialists for a game that has a lot depending on it in terms of the franchise name and revival.

This pretty much sums up the game when it is working and you can log in. The assault rifles are underpowered or maybe I'm just used to realistic gun ballistic work in insurgency sandstorm. The game doesn't have a region filter option or an option to turn cross-play off in-game. The specialist classes imo are just a way to include females on the battleground, no offense females but on the real battlefield, ya don't see chicks running around with the infantry. I would prefer character customization instead of barely noticeable specialist classes. The game makes everyone a winner by only showing what you did well and does not display KD for yourself or anyone else in-game. Not to mention no story mode for a 60 dollar game and yeah I did buy the 100 edition in the hopes the game would have good content, work correctly. and maybe the DLC will be decent, maybe? Overall this is a lazy cookie-cutter game trying to keep pace with that other big-name seller CoD. I would rather see Arma ported to console than play this trash tbh.",2021-11-13T18:24:02Z,0,1

DLSS works by lowering render resolution so the GPU can dish out more frames. but if the system is CPU limited, what happened is the GPU will just sit around idling, waiting for the CPU to send the next frame data to the GPU to render. the frame drops also support suspicion that it is CPU limited.

But Portal looks really promising and with BF Bad company 2 being my fav fps of all time, I hope to see more of that in the future. But what's up with all these undercooked games.

That's also my problem with BF2042. I think the game would be a lot more immersive if they had cut out the whole ""nopat"" or expat thing and removed the specialists. Because it's a near future setting I don't mind stuff like the sentry turret, grapple gun and even the wallhack thing, but I hate that they are locked behind these ridiculous ""specialists"". 
It makes no sense to have a game mode with 128 players be occupied by a dozen specialists, it completely destroys any sense of immersion knowing that there is probably 30 Boris' running around on the battlefield, 18 Sundance's and so on. That should've been replaced with Russian, Chinese and American grunts. It's much easier to believe a bunch of Russian grunts in 2042 would be carrying sentry guns to the frontline, whilst American grunts are using hyper advanced scanners to detect infantry through walls. It would also be more immersive in my opinion, to get to decide the sex and outfit of my character:
I hate that if I want to use Sundance's wingsuit, I have to be this black woman wearing a beanie, or that if I wanna call in a resupply station, I have to look like a civilian with a backpack (seriously, Angel looks more like a guy working in IT than he does a soldier). 

I think that's my biggest issue as well, look at Halo Infinite, they let you customize your own Spartan that fits into the Halo universe, I want to do the same thing for Battlefield, I want to make a soldier that looks like he belongs in a warzone and way too many of the operators don't look like that, most of them don't even have a helmet. Irish is probably the closest one, Dozer is up there too but that gasmask is ridiculous, trust me, I work in a Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear (CBRN) army unit, and fighting with a gasmask on is beyond difficult.  
I really miss the Battlefield 3 and especially 4's character models, they looked great and it was easy to tell if someone was a medic, engineer, support or recon way before you pressed the spotting button. More importantly, they looked like soldiers in an army, ready to fight in global conflict. Specialists looks like a teenager's idea of how they would go to war, ""yeah, if I was SEAL team 6 I would've just used a wingsuit to fly right through the windows and killed Bin Laden with an SMG lol... What? Body armor? Helmets? I'm just gonna wear something tactical... like a black beanie!"".",2021-11-13T06:47:45Z,3,40

The fanbase will deplete with people like this making videos even tho each battlefield has come out half baked and always blossomed into the beautiful game we love and enjoy. People who are battlefield exclusive and never branched out are probably going to struggle with the technicality but if these player were willing to be to be open minded maybe they would enjoy the game as much as I do. The operator system while annoying is something people should pretty easily adjust too and does little to take away from the experience.
+I understand the game doesnt perform well on PC but for the time being can't you just cap at 80fps and play, all I see in lobby chat is PC players flexing their PC's then proceeding to cry when it drops below 120 fps, in due time im sure you'll be able to reach these numbers again just dont play for a bit or make limitations.",2021-11-13T05:48:13Z,0,1

Had some typical dice please moments after getting teleported across half of the map and back but that's it when it came to Bugs. Oh and I forgot that trying to change your ammotype makes your character do a super janky looking animation and you end up with your knife pulled out (Dice please again) But with the rest I have to agree with the review Dice has to deliver otherwise the Franchise is done. Plus they defo have to tweak the gunplay and ttk there are some pretty...wonky things going on in there. So conclusion for me is...I give Dice that one last shot, if the first year fixes the many issues like Specialists etc. They can maybe rescue the Franchise and I'll keep on playing and giving my money for it...but if they won't...I will say goodbye to Battlefield with one last heavyhearted salute and leave it for good.

Apart from all that, I'm still very skeptical towards some of the other balance aspects. A sniper that 1-hit bodyshots within 100m? Who thought that was a good idea? Armour plates for infantry to reduce damage? I don't think there's a single game in which a perk like that didn't screw gun balancing.
All that makes me kind of sad, because I really wanna play a Battlefield game again. But it just doesn't seem like the game for me at the moment.

But at *Ultra* settings in all out war(128 players), weather effects, lots to render on the map, good graphics, chaos on top of chaos, and you're still hitting 100 fps isn't bad. 
I mean you can't compare the performance of this game to many others because there aren't many others like that.
Yes performance on the next gen consoles is much more stable but next gen consoles are running at like medium to low settings. 

Yes they most likely needed to delay the game just to optimize but it's not surprising that they had a hard time optimizing the game with how much it should stress everyone's systems with just the concept of 128 player breakthrough game mode alone at the visual fidelity it's at.",2021-11-12T23:35:39Z,1,2

Credit where credit is due; it performed WAY better than the Beta did, and was definitely more fun, at least for a bit. The maps other than Orbital were much better - I definitely enjoyed Manifest (the cargo container one) a good deal. That said, it still has MAJOR issues, and unlike Skillup, I'll come right out and say it - 2042 was DEFINITELY a Battle Royale with Hazard Zone as first, then adapted into a traditional Battlefield later when they realized it wasn't gonna work out.

Hazard Zone is completely skippable and should've just been scrapped, because Hunt and Tarkov do everything it is trying to do, but better and with better takes on the idea. 

But all the design decisions, from how maps flow, how buildings are grouped together on many maps, how they're so basic and bare, how destruction works, Specialists and the loss of the class system to even the weapon customization system all scream ""BATTLE ROYALE IDEAS"" because they all make sense there and feel like they belong there, not in a Battlefield game. And all these non-Battlefield elements leave the game feeling like a weird mix of Warzone and Blackout's 50v50 mode, not Battlefield.


But one thing I will say they did well above everything else; the weather. Not only does it look great, but goddamn do you FEEL it, especially if you're in the wrong place at the wrong time.",2021-11-12T23:16:30Z,2,29

I'm not going to go far left and say it is the worst game I have ever played and I'm not going to go far right and say it's incredible. I will say I had a lot of fun during the beta. My outlook, a game which has potential to be incredible but is a bit of a bumpy ride right now. But think about it when have we ever had a perfect Battlefield launch yeah never, and the greatest games in this franchise and some of the best fps games ever were broken as hell at launch (BF3, BF4).

The lack of a campaign, specialists are dumb, fairly useless classes, every one has a defibrillator so no reason to be medic class, lack of guns, no peak/lean toggle, glitches, portal maps look good but don't hit the same as 4. Shooting/sniping doesn't hit the same feels just ok, seems like less destructible environment compared to 2, 3, and 4. Team chat doesn't work or there is none, these are just issues I have with the game I've waited years for and hoped would be up to par if not better than 4. Why they keep allowing you to see the person who kills you highlighted red through objects like they also did in 4 is beyond me. Kills immersion and is unrealistic and gives away your position. I'm disappointed. I'll still play since I bought it but why couldn't they make a battlefield without all the bs specialists, and the ability to lean around corners which 4 had..............God damn you ea for selling out with microtransactions and focusing more on that than creating an instant classic like 4 was",2021-11-12T19:24:02Z,0,0

Played it today on a Xbox one x all day (New Zealand location change) I do not like it. Specialists suck. As everyone said, getting rid of the class system was dumb. Comparing gameplay to battlefield 3 or 4, Or 1, it's a joke. Gunplay feels bad. Clunky, It's closer to pubG than battlefield or cod. Time to kill is really inconsistent. Worse than previous installments. It's like playing a bad version of Warzone. Maybe if all you've experienced is bf-V, you'll probably like this. Map design is disappointing too. The portal is a neat idea, but it needs a considerable amount of work too. Portal is what people will be playing within a few months when people quit playing the base 2042 game. I don't see this being a fan favorite like others. It also graphically isn't great on Xbox one. If you don't have one, I'd wait to get it when the Series X or PS5 is more available, if you dig consoles.  Right now, either way, on any platform, I'd pass on this.

There is no class identity anymore, anyone can do anything. I loved the unique identities in the Battlefield games (medic, recon, support and assault). Now you won't have a clue who is doing what and have to pray to the RNG gods that someone is carrying a medical kit or ammo crate in your assault team / squad. Portal is OK... it's great that you can play the old content again with new skins.... But its exactly that.... Recycled content with a new skin. Hopefully it will grow on me.

Dice have said that hazard zone was designed as a love letter to BF fans.... To me, an old BF fan, a love letter would be... the best conquest mode we've ever seen. That's what I don't get. BF's identity, the sole reason I want to play, is conquest. I want the maps, classes EVERYTHING to be balanced around conquest. The rest is fluff. And I think most old school BFs fans would agree. Which is why I'm puzzled that our 'love letter' is another game mode... that borrows surface elements from other games that aren't BF.  Portal seems like a much better love letter as well. 
I'm afraid they put a lot of effort (and unfortunately balance) into the least interesting part of the game.

As for performance.... I mean, if you pre-order a BF game after BF4 happened, you a lost cause. And the lack of console codes in a world where Cyberpunk happened is just terrifying. I hope things go great for the console peeps but shit smells bad.

Basically that cancels out. In the beta Orbital, I don't feel the increase to 128 players there as there are no capture point in the map wherein you'll fight 20 or more. Players are so scattered because the maps are larger that you will not notice the increase.

Been playing BF since 2002 so looking forward to 7pm tonight when I can get into this.  Some of the games in the series have been a bit lacking but the whole franchise still holds a special place in my little gaming heart.  Loved 2142 so lets hope 2042 can make it.  Regardless I imagine I will keep buying and playing BF games until I physically am unable to play anymore.

Player count has doubled over BFV, meaning that CPU stress is probably also doubled. That Dice managed to keep the performance downgrade (vs BFV) less than 50% already shows incredible optimization and cleverness.

Frostbite engine scales to 8 cores, but most important is high single thread performance. There is no CPU today fast enough singly threaded maintain over 100 FPS for BF2042. 

Intel 12600k or 12900k w/ low latency DDR5 will get you close but not all the way there.

Because if this fails - there might not be a next one.   But if the same stuff remains, no scoreboard, no classes then the last BF that I would call BF would be BF 4 in the modern era.  
I think you're right - HZ should have been it's own title (free to play) and BF 2042 should have been the way we all expected it to be and the way we love.  The original style, classes , scoreboard etc.. is what set it apart for the others and drew in the player base it has today.",2021-11-12T03:08:57Z,0,0

Even a 5600x is faster than the 3950x. Alderlake has much better ST performance, so if this game has bad multithreading then alderlake is going to perform a lot better.

the audio reminds me of tarkov gameplay but somehow worse that clip really showed me. if thats AAA game comp standards im honestly flabbergasted.

games are demanding more and more and often giving less and less its nice that battlefield might cater to lower end but i have a 1060 super and i5 and cant run the beta and anything more than that isnt mid end IMO. also this sucks for anyone with a top of the line pc which shouldnt make sense if their are issues with a machine of higher capabilities than optimize and delay till its good to go will be rough if they push this game with all these issues but taking the NW release into consideration i have little faith. love how i can think a game isnt fun yet i can still enjoy your reviews great vids glhf",2021-11-12T00:59:15Z,0,0

Battlefield was in a dire need of a refresh and this next gen hardware was a good opportunity for them to go big with the level of detail / scale. They can't even get the game to run well for the release on modern hardware so I have zero hope for last gen stuff. 

What is with every studio wanting to just push out a product that is unfinished? Not only do they hurt sales for their product but they also hurt future releases from their studios and publishers because it sets a bad track record / precedent. What happened to game studios knowing the target audience for a game and just focusing on delivering a solid product for them? Everything needs to be pumped out at lightning speed now adays and must appeal to as wide of an audience as possible. 

Drop last gen support and focus on current hardware that just came out that people will be using for the next 4-5 years. And actually release the game when it is in a finished state....",2021-11-12T00:26:53Z,0,0

With no classes , crappy performance on the staple experience bf players would go in for ; I'm really not interested in this title right now. Portal looks like a great idea but when so many core long standing game modes and features are either not present or run like garbage ...I'm just not excited for this... 

F2p games I think are terrible just becaues all its funding is microtransaction driven which means if you really like it; you could spend hundreds of dollars on it... f2p I think is a glorified atm for developers... just not a fan.

Tornadoes are not fluffy clouds of air- it's a sheer, nightmarish, well, ""Finger of God"" (His middle finger specifically). Even for a gameplay stance, just have a destructive instant-death tornado on the field could have opened up so many cool atmospheric gaming moments of being stuck in a building while it's passing through, being in a gun fight, and seeing it just annihilate anyone outside too stupid to know those things are death incarnate.

As is, based on footage, it's just a dumb turbo booster and air lifter. A tornado of that ferocity can turn a plastic straw into a razerblade. And if this thing was in Fortnite, I wouldn't be so hard on it. But it's in Battlefield, a series known for it's (to a varying degree granted) level of realism, and it just takes me out of the experience seeing a bunch of realistically modeled idiots hang-gliding around a funnel cloud.",2021-11-11T20:38:54Z,0,0

And with any luck you'd be able to use the team based systems of the older games with the new maps through portal, so that we can experience the newer content, without the annoying change to the core battlefield experience.

Look at the market right now. You CAN'T buy 20xx cards anymore at retail since Nvidia stopped producing them. You CAN'T buy a 30xx series card since... reportedly... Nvidia has stopped production right now BUT EVEN IF THEY DIDN'T you still can't buy one. 

The only way to get a new card is to pay $2,000+ to a scalper or Newegg. No one is going to do that. 

What can you buy right now? 10xx cards. 1650 Supers are ALL OVER THE PLACE right now in retail stores, and for a lot of people those are actually an upgrade vs what they had before. 

In a normal market - performance would be a priority on the newest hardware because people would be able to buy it. We can't right now - so what's the point in making that the priority? Just so a reviewer can say ""Well on my 3090 it ran at 300fps!"" That's unrealistic performance that 0.0001% of players are going to have. 

Also - All Out War mode will for sure be the worst performing of all the modes and that shouldn't be a shocker to anyone. When Battlefield moved to larger servers for consoles and unlocked the framerate we saw performance bumps for sure, but the framerate was inconsistent and bad to play. 

PC players are now getting that short end of the stick. DICE makes a really great visual engine and they are constatnly pushing Frostbite to spit out some of the best graphics that we have today. They are at the same time however forgetting to optimize that engine for the one thing their games are known for - large scale battles. 

Whats the point in having this photo realistic fidelity levels for the game when it runs like absolute dog water.",2021-11-11T18:32:56Z,0,0

Edit (11/13): Ok I underestimated how bad the performance would be on my PC. 100% CPU usage with a 4-core i5 7600K. GPU and RAM are fairly well optimized, but this game was keeping all 4 of my cores at 100% making it very hard to aim with it stuttering every second or two. I would say that it was unplayable if not for the fact that it seemed like everyone else was also experiencing their own performance issues (that or they were just bad players).

I really do like your work.  As usual the gaming community being fully retarded will buy this game.  Many many copies of this game will sell while still not being fit for purpose.  Why because the gaming community is stupid.  The standards/expectations are so low that the gaming companies know they can sell a bad product and stupid people will buy it.  Games need to be fully functional on release that's what testing is for.  Bah I am sick of saying it the gaming companies know this so welcome to shit games from here on out.  I for one will no longer buy multiplayer games its just not worth the money and frustrations and I will only buy single player games when they are on special like 80 percent off at least.  The only games I may buy at full price are indie games that are spectacular they deserve the money they charge imo.  End rant.  If you got this far thanks for reading.

But everything i do know has me very concerned.  
You say i should wait a year? ... sure, no problem... but what about that Battlepass System, is that paid? Is it time limited? Do i have to be there to grind out whatever is inside in time or is it like Halo where i can work on those assignments whenever i get around to it and on my own speed?  

...and if you can't get the game to run at a solid 144 FPS on an RTX 3090 ... holy shit what is my GTX 1080 gonna do with this?  
What are they thinking making such a hardware intensive game at a time where nobody can even buy Hardware?

moral of the story with that seems to be the game is very cpu heavy and that makes a lot of sense, 128 players/AI and everything going on its hardly too surprising but its also on them to recommend the correct hardware because clearly a recommendation of a 2700x isn't in the ball park.

i can say for sure at high/medium settings at 4k using a 5900x/3080/32gb 3733 ram on the beta i was getting around 70fps, sometimes higher sometimes lower, no DLSS because it wasn't available and no RT ofcourse.

the other issue with the game which you didn't mention is the beta was locked in DX12 mode... notoriously shit in battlefield 1 and V and often using DX11 improved frame timing massively and thus the experience... was this available in the release build of 2042? did you use it?",2021-11-11T16:18:17Z,0,0

My friend on an RTX 3050 and Ryzen 5000 series laptop struggled to get 45 50 fps on low 1080p and he had around 10 15 fps on high/ultra. It was literally unplayable for him.

It really turned us off from ever wanting to buy and play this game. For comparison we run Forza Horizon 5 on stable 60 fps on mixed medium-ultra settings and i ran Metro Exodus on ultra on the 580",2021-11-11T15:17:01Z,0,1

Just a bit of info on performance... the reason that DLSS doesn't help your FPS much is because you are already CPU bottlenecked the majority of the time at 1440p (due to terrible optimisation of the large match types and the 3090 being an awesome GPU). Using AI to reduce the render resolution and scale it up again doesn't offer much more performance because your CPU can only feed frames to your GPU so quickly. You will see much more difference in 4k, but even there the 3090 is bottlenecked by the 5950x in combat a lot of the time.",2021-11-11T15:12:26Z,0,0

After playing CoD: Vanguard and enjoying the story I really wanted a great near future military tech game with a decent story as the opposite of Vanguards WW2 setting. Helps build the world you are playing in for multiplayer. build characters back stories, familiarize yourself with weapons, etc. And it usually gives players something to fall back on until the multiplayer gets ironed out at launch. Terrible decision on that one EA/Dice. With Vanguard, Riders Republic, Forza Horizon 5 and Jurrasic World Evo 2 as well as this input I think I'll hold off for a while.

Sure there's the portal mode, but that's it, it's just a side mode. The game was clearly intended to steer into the specialists/heroes and abandon what the series was always about.

The 128 players also did nothing for me. You are put into maps too big to have any frontline and without classes and squads it just becomes free for all with teams. Many times people accuse call of duty of never changing, but they don't change too much because they found a formula that works well for that series. Battlefield 2042 is like the awkward call of duty, that wants to be sci fi with super powers, but that's not what the audience of that series is looking for.",2021-11-11T14:20:04Z,0,0

Vote with your wallet. Keep buying this stuff this is what EA/Dice will keep serving, and the Battlefield franchise will get even more distorted from here.

Ill still be there day 1 with twitter and reddit open hoping to know when the next patch is coming to fix things. I just want new jeep stuff and dipping my potato chips into players. Battlefield is back and buggy and i cant wait!,2021-11-11T14:13:16Z,0,0

Eight years ago I bought an AMD 7950 OC, which at the time was one of the fastest GPUs you could buy.  Something today that is only slightly faster costs TWICE as much (inflation adjusted).  Moreover, a comparable card with regards to ""performance bracket"" costs SIX times as much.  Hell, the GPU costs more than the rest of the PC combined (in the case of a 3090 more than double the price of the rest of the PC).  I want to ask, who are these people actually able to afford 3090s, that struggle to perform in a game like this no less?  I am convinced the average gamer is definately not able to.

The lack of performance goodness over the GPU change is because the game is now bottle necked by CPU instead of GPU. This has been known since the beta and this is one of the major challenges they're having to optimise currently. Your graphics card wouldn't boost performance as much as a good CPU. It's hard to explain, but a 3950X is the same CPU I have in my computer (GTX 1080ti + 3950X), and it performed significantly better than my laptop (+10FPS extra). (5600H + 3060) although these two systems should be almost mirrored in performance, minus the extra features the 3060 can offer to make the game run faster (DLSS). 

The rendering of the game may be being held back due to the restraints of the systems made by the CPU. My sussy thoughts is that the system which is trying to stream a buffer of data to the GPU, the CPU trying it's best to process the memory from the RAM and sending it to the GPU and such. I dooon't think the game utilises direct memory access on PC, which is why we're getting this terrible performance because it's trying to replicate that method of sending data to the GPU which is causing it.

I think the best performance improvement is comparing it to a higher spec CPU mainly rather than the GPU. I haven't done that much research into it however.",2021-11-11T14:07:57Z,1,5

You can only use the logic editor in Team Death Match and Free-For-All which means you can't full customize weapons & gadget loadouts in Conquest/Conquest Large or Rush game modes. Classes are restricted to only have access to the gear that is available in that classes base game. This means Battlefield 3 classes can only use Battlefield 3 weapons and gear. The only way to circumvent this is with the logic editor which can't be used on Objective based game modes. This was done intentionally to restrict players from making custom games that compete with the default 2042 All Out Warfare mode.,2021-11-11T14:02:49Z,0,0

Whilst it looks like BF2042 isn't terribly well optimized, your low performance numbers may be attributed to your CPU. The Ryzen 3000 series is great but is no longer the latest and best, and may struggle with this game at lower resolutions such as 1440 low settings or with DLSS. I am curious if you went to 4K on your 3090 if you'd get similar FPS (70-80) due to a potential CPU bottleneck.

Still, I have a R9 3900x & RTX 3800 so your performance report was super useful for me. Thanks as always!",2021-11-11T13:57:01Z,0,1

Personally I'm the exact type of person you mentioned at the end, I just want more Battlefield rather than the next iteration of Warzone or something else but that's why I think I and a lot of others will be spending a lot of time in Portal.

BFV was ""set of great ideas executed terribly"" and was just ""enjoyable"" after many patches. I wouldn't call it good game tho. BF4 is one of the most overrated games I've played. It was good but it wasn't ""peak BF"" as many claim it was. 

BF2042 beta was huge dissapointment, especially as it ran awfully and threw away almost everything previous Battlefields brought to the franchise. Everything was half-assed for sake of being different from predecessors. Sad cost of this decision: it was different than what we've seen in previous games but there was nothing original, just inferior copies of other games.


I have no hope for BF2042. This ""review in progress"" only made me more convinced that I will not buy this game yet. However I am much more optimistic then I was after beta. I would consider it if performance+audio is fixed or when portal gets BF2143.

BTW: 2080Ti is still very high-end part. Especially when we take into consideration how much more powerful it is than consoles' GPUs and how expensive it is.
BF1 was fully functional on release, performance was great, so was audio.",2021-11-11T13:23:51Z,0,0

It felt like battlefront that they slapped battlefield onto. Personally from what I'm seeing and hearing I'm personally glad they went back to the bf3 and bf4 style of gameplay.

BF is my jam. still gonna play it. still gonna enjoy (what I can as of now). Nvidia noted that the drivers are more or less the same as the beta drivers. in a couple months id expect some improvements. We're playing AAA games that are still in major development. If you have the mindset that the game doesn't come out till June or even august or next year. Good for you, I cannot.

Advanced movement and specialists really don't belong in the battlefield formula, made this feel more like a apex legends clone than a battlefield game. I had high hopes, sure portal looks great but it seems like damage control so they can still get away with selling specialists as microtransactions but I'm sure they won't stop with just specialist. It's a pity a secondary mode is what people are most interested in, if dice focused more on what the community actually wanted from a new battlefield title imagine how much better this could have been.
