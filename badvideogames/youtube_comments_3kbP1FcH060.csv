If you're a giant corporation, IGN is going to be very cautious to ever review your products badly. Reviewing the products badly means that IGN no longer gets advanced copies to review in the future, and no longer has their staff flown out for extravagant events.

To know what a review really is, all you need to do is subtract 5 from both sides.
A game which is 7/10 is actually a 2/5. A game which is 9 is actually 4/5.

IGN doesn't exist to serve its audience. They exist to serve the developers and provide them with fluff pieces like this.",2024-08-30T12:21:29Z,0,0

I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories",2024-08-28T00:40:22Z,0,0
