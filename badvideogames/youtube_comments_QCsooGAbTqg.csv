I probably would have dropped it after getting to the open world anyway since being swarmed by enemies and forever respawning enemies would have annoyed me too much.
I do hope Mundfish will be able to make another game though. They have potential to make a great game if they take criticism, apply all they've learned, and narrowing their vision a bit more.",2024-03-21T23:47:36Z,0,0

There are a few bad and frustrating parts in the game but still, in my opinion it’s a fantastic game for Mundfishes first game, and also idk why this guy thinks reminders in the game is so frustrating like their just there to REMIND you and I really don’t mind the same enemies and the bosses are great, and just because their resistant to some stuff doesn’t make it boring and frustrating it makes it fun and different. Also a game can be tons of things at once idk why he included that in this. I don’t get why people say the character is annoying, because he says “crispy critters” a lot makes them annoyed.

No reason to compare the 2 mist games get inspiration from past just like movies and music. Game was good minus the longwalk in beginning and the bugs. Lots of games have history museums .Prey didn't start that either n it look completely diff. Vid Just sound like nitpicking , especially the algae farm ride part. It takes like 2 mins to do. yet vid says it so long they almost quit?! Thats a great area to farm btw. Sound like u dont like story or puzzle games either. Fell in water myself by balls puzzle &finished it fine. If an item is stuck ur supposed to use ur scanner for prompt, in vid u didnt do that.

It does have some issues with the geometry as I have been stuck several times where I had to re-load, and they have a horrible voice actor dubbing in English.  The powers are very enjoyable and the weapon upgrades are intuitive.  I would say powers are very hard to implement in games.  Either they have no use compared to the other powers you can obtain or they are so overpowered you stick with those and no others.  I feel they made powers a little too powerful, but at least they all appear to be viable.  I intentionally stay away from powers that make the game too easy.  This is slightly bad design, but I feel most games with powers have combo's that trivialize gameplay. You were definitely correct about item information though.  There is no easy way to figure out what stat boosts you get from different items based on the indicators they display.",2023-04-12T00:26:41Z,0,0

Yes, there are many technical issues, like some checkpoint problem, crashes, softlocks (thought there weren't more than 2 of everything from list to me), there are problems with polymer clay (which i only used to solve 1.5 puzzles and immediately uninstalled because of other 2.5 actually enjoyable powers), but it's still a very good solid game, many games don't have this level of entertainment.

18:30 there. I'm a big fan of the ""just because it's fun"" method. I don't stop playing games because it's just fun, if there wasn't ""just because"" factor, nobody would have played games. If you feel that you don't have reason to upgrade +0.5 damage, why ever playing video games? Every game (outside of ""movie""games or some ""deep philosophical"" games) is played just for fun, so why not experiment for yourself if you are actively being bored without experimenting?

You didn't break anything, you just choose to play very boring. Freeze, then spray polymer, then hit with a heavy attack while holding LMB — while I just zip 'em and shoot with a shotgun. Easy, faster, more effective and more fun. Gameplay is really good, shooting mechanics is a mix between Far Cry and Bioshock Infinite. When you got a satellite thing in Prey that can kick away Nightmare did you also criticised it for being broken? Same with rocket launcher. I thank the developers for letting me having fun. This is not a cybersport discipline with further mathematics in every aspect.

I hated the intro, it took WAY too long to wander around the area and see and experience everything, for a first time playthrough.  I was so fucking bored because I just wanted to experience the GAME, not the interactive cinema.

It could have been so much better if the first experience of the game was a training zone, in which you get your mission briefing while getting to play with the guns and other weapons, and also to meet the glove AI that annoys you for the rest of the game.

Instead you are thrust into a playable cutscene where your glove and your character act like a miserable married couple, and while the lore is good (I enjoyed it), it is far too long winded.  

Devs need to remember that a game is a GAME, not an interactive movie.  And the worst part is, when you get to play the game, one of the bots can grab you and snap your neck, because you were never shown the QTE was a thing, you just have to die a few times before you learn.

Atomic Heart is a mish mash of games that came before it, but they just don't gel together in a way that creates a harmonious experience.  

The setting and the atmosphere, and the animations of the bots, are the only parts I liked.  Everything else just put me off.  Glad I didn't buy it, but I might do for $10 in a sale.",2023-03-11T00:49:49Z,0,0

That's like the most basic expectation. To me, Atomic Heart feels like a game that *looks* triple-AAA but plays like something on the cusp of B-games. Think Chernobylite and colpare them. Same focus on visual fidelity but with some sacifices in core gameplay loop.

I think like a lot of other people: They probably got overambitious with a few factors (open world, visuals, animations, extra easter egg stuff) and it took away time they could have used to spend more on core gameplay and UI stuff.

I wonder whether Mundfish REALLY is all that small though. They clearly had budget to pull something like this off. The way we define indie has heavily chabged over the years too. Some people even call Cheenobylite and indie studio but they released multiple games and have enough investments to scan Pripyat thoroughly.",2023-03-06T02:17:22Z,0,2

This game needs a real hard mode ASAP. It's insultingly easy even on Armageddon difficulty. You think polymer + ice is overpowered? Just get mass telekinesis and upgrade it to have slam. That's it, you are set for the rest of the entire game. Everything else is to spice up the completely boring, unchallenging and monotonous combat. For the bosses, just use telekinesis + the alternative fire on the morning star (the one that fires its disks away) + an elemental canister the boss is weak against. Voila, you melt it in 2 minutes. Not to mention, you have so much items at your disposal at any given time, you can stock up on them for an even easier time.
They really dropped the ball in terms of difficulty and actual satisfaction from getting through actual tough encounters. And, yeah, the world feels unique and carefully crafted...in the beginning, until you start seeing the same couple of assets over and over again.
You know, there's another older ""Russian Bioshock"" game called ""Singularity"". It also has a magic glove with plasmid-like abilities and it's 10 times better: more action packed, way more challenging. Give it a go!",2023-03-01T19:10:08Z,0,0

I think it was best to not have ANY expectations coming into this game. It was my mistake for thinking this game was going to be open world bioshock and it would be great. It wasn’t. The open world sucked and combat was repetitive. 

The game starts off hot but gets worse the further you get. You die more from getting stuck in a corner than from the enemies. The boss fights were slow and boring. The movement is too limited ( No Sprint ). And I understand there needs to be balance and sprint might be OP but you can add a stamina bar that gives you limited sprint and make the enemies more aggressive so you can’t get away easy. The devs should’ve figured it out.

I beat the game on Armageddon (Hardest difficulty) and didn’t find it to be difficult. I died 7 times total and it was mostly because I got stuck. Never died to a boss. It was a very forgiving experience. The enemies/bosses would let me double dash away and heal/reload my gun and as long as I had heals, I wasn’t able to die. 

This game for me was a lesson of “having high expectations all the time means you will get disappointed more often” and I was reminded that after I completed the game. Thank god for game pass.",2023-02-24T14:50:45Z,0,0

FOV slider can be fixed by dragging a file into the paks folder. Sticking can be fixed by smashing movement, jump and dash to unstuck just like every other game. The game runs smoothly for such a graphically good game. The protagonist isn’t designed good but he isn’t designed badly. The dialogue is supposed to show the character’s personality and you’re missing out the story. I find combat fun as movement is not bad as you mentioned in your video. You can Dodge every attack as a reward for good reflexes. The whole point of combat is learning the enemies and yourself to exploit them. You do need to find a specific resource when you want for example thermal scope on your AK. There’s three difficulty option in the release version: journalists, easy and normal. This isn’t a competitive multiplayer game. You don’t need to equip the most op abilities. It’s up to the players preference.

Missing fov sliders and such - I couldn't care less. I also like that the abilities are available from the start and stuff is not locked behind some stupid progression system. I don't need things like that for having fun. The only thing that really put me off was that douchebag of a main character. Evidence in mails, audio snippets, people are telling him what he should consider - but nothing. No reaction. The protagonist continues to talk his stupid and stubborn talk or draws astonishing conclusions - in a bad way. For hours and hours. Until you get to the very end and here lots of things are left pretty unclear.",2023-02-23T15:51:44Z,0,0

I did crash once and I had Frame Rate issues but I am also playing on a last Gen Xbox. Remember this is Mundfish's first game, while visually impressive it is still an Indie game. We got what was promised in those trailers, the gameplay was boring because you played it in one particular way. You hardly used all your abilities until forced to. Maybe because you were on Easy, since you said there wasn't a difficulty slider. There was, I played it a day early and it was there.

(Review),2023-02-20T13:07:32Z,@AkaraVortex,"Even if this is first studio's attempt, this can not justify annoying characters. The protagonist is too irritating for the game with obvious comedic inclination, he is constantly buzzing and spills out with aggression, and this is the same for russian voiceover. And his hand companion is not much better, but at least he can bring sometimes memorable dialogues.

You can say something is wrong with the game when on every single damn thumbnail of video or stream there are these 2 damn ballerinas, as if there is nothing more interesting in this game.

And the gameplay is so... unimaginative and uninventive, your typical guns and weapons against dumb AIs, I don't even know what's wrong, it is just bald.

The design vision and aesthetics are great (if you happens to like this 50s style), but graphics in-buildings looks cheap, and on the outside it is mostly amazing work of Unreal Engine with foliage.

With neuropolymer technologies you can become anyone they said... except female, of course, this is against soviet traditions. 

...why so many dislikes under this video, this is some genuinely good critique, do people really have got so easily impressed by visuals, that the everything other in the game does not matter anymore?",2023-02-22T16:41:56Z,0,1

Very ambitious but it feels like a first attempt! Graphics and story are amazing. Gameplay is a mess. Lack of core gameplay loop and trying to be multiple genres at once, overly simple repeated puzzles, savepoint glitches, etc.

This game could really benefit from either focusing on linear action or open world scrounging. The idea of trying to merge the two is admittedly interesting but they really don't mesh well, it essentially makes 2 different games. 

Also yeah, the main guy's 4th wall break gimmick is VERY irritating. Once and a while might be ok, but constantly is just irritating to be around.",2023-02-22T11:58:14Z,0,0

Lately it's been hard to finish a game because I feel like many titles get boring and repetitive pretty fast. However with atomic heart I've basically binge played this game and nearly finished. I definitely give atomic heart and A. I've noticed a little screen tearing but besides that it's definitely a lot more polished than most games released today.

The gameplay and design is just terrible for a game that has such wonderful aesthetics.  And the controls are so clunky on both keyboard and controller.

I don't really know what happened to this game specifically but I think I can give a verdict as to why there are so many mixed reviews from people who are on both extremes.
Starting with the side of the people who disappointed him or did not like:
- The current situation in the world made video game magazines look at it with bad eyes, this is a fact.
- people had this game through the roof, so much so that the expectations they had for it were completely impossible to exceed
To people who liked it (including me):
- it's not a minority, in fact the vast majority of people loved this game, I really can't empathize with people who criticize its gameplay, saying it's monotonous or not well done, since it's hectic and all the time you change your arsenal, improve it and gain skills.

People who didn't even like it give points in favor of the setting and story, what I see being criticized the most is the gameplay, but I don't know what they expected nor do I understand what the point to criticize is, it seems like a game to me too solid, that it was eaten by the expectations of the people (it is being a minority) and the current situation in the world does not help",2023-02-21T20:39:26Z,0,0

So many others do things like this in this nature where they cut to some film footage or an anime briefly and thinks its funny but in reality it just annoying and distracting and i hate it. It doesn't add anything but subtracts alot, at least for me.

I guess it is a self-criticism that you do for realising how much you said that word and felt bad about it so you thought to change it into a joke to feel fine about it and to discard comments from people later on if they were to say ""oh you sure said prey alot, is this an atomic heart review or prey review haha"" but it's distracting and annoying alot.

I love watching your videos because unlike most other people/channel, you give a sh*t about gameplay more than anything else which is the only thing i care about in video games and that's why i tune into your videos if you talk about a newly released video game to see what you think about that game but you do this sometimes in some of your other videos aswell and it makes me watch it still but with contantly rolling my eyes and going ""sigh..""",2023-02-20T19:39:54Z,0,0

If you have not played that one, I recommended it. It has the same idea as Atomic Heart, combining gunplay with magic-like abilities. But the levels are more linear, although they are pretty big, with a lot of optional exploration. Higher difficulties actually challenge you to combine weapons, magic and environmental damage. And the story is really good. Oh, and the protagonist says one sentence at the beginning and then shuts up for the rest of the game xD",2023-02-20T19:01:36Z,1,0

Like yeah I think there's no denying that this world looks sick af; but from what you showed, it looks like it teeters between being boring and being too chaotic. Like I got frustrated watching most of this gameplay, from having to charge up melee attacks on frozen enemies multiple times, to being forced into a melee only boss fight, to seeing that you can't even treat this game like an immersive sim (that one really hurt my heart). It truly sucks to see a game with so much passion put into it not live up to the hype.

Sad that the work of the artists is gonna be put down by other possible ""reviewers"" who will say things like ""Russia bad now so boycott"" despite the fictional story on display. I expect the same lazy op-ed tha those done for Hogwarts' Legacy.

The lack of FOV is not acceptable in this day and age. Any first-person game, especially shooters, should have one. Even I started developing syndromes linked to motion sickness. Anything under 90 (horizontal) is not okay for me and I put DOOM at 110. Until this is patched (and the devs should know better), I'm avoiding this game. Also I wonder if there are any other things you can change in the UI. 

And yes, tutorials interrupting mid-gameplay is insulting. It's condescending and a syndrome of modern gaming. It's funny how yesterday I watched a clip from Day9TV pointing out how Metroid Prime, even with its Remaster, stayed away from pointing out the obvious as modern games would do... a game that gives you the option to turn off the Hint System. It's funny how some devs have no faith in players finding their path forward. And now, I believe it's getting worse and worse even from indie devs.",2023-02-20T17:20:09Z,0,0

The game it most looks like to me in terms of level design, combat, and even story would be Bioshock. Problem is, the combat in Bioshock, while ""hectic"", DID actually take your resources most of the time. This feels like a mix between Bioshock and higher paced actiony games like modern Doom. Issue is, those don't REALLY mesh well together. Watching your gameplay, I wish the movement/fighting was more slow-paced, and then have the combat match that speed, like Bioshock and/or Prey. Looks like there's a lot of potential here, but with the amount of marketing the game had, I definitely expected something better. But alas.

Also wow, that main character's dialogue sounds garbage. The AI doesn't sound as bad but I imagine in conjunction it's pretty bad. It feels like the guy is from an entirely different genre of game and got dropped into this one.",2023-02-20T17:13:24Z,1,1

It get's clicks and views at the expense of video games. Same thing with Forspoken, Halo Infinite, etc. This game according to everything on the internet over the past few years to now is exactly what it was sold to be. It wasn't overhyped, expectations were not set by anyone, nothing. The game comes out, and its good and far beyond better than 70% of the games that have come out over the last year, but because its not a first-party Sony game and not trending on Twitter or dominating headlines, it is written off as a ""failure"" or ""disappointment"". Doesn't help that this game came out on Game Pass, which is even more of an excuse people will have to write it off. Pentiment was amazing, the rest of the world ""oh its disappointing"". Plague Tale Requiem was multiplat but a GP release and was amazing, the rest of the world ""oh its a disappointment"", High on Life was an INDIE game ""oh its a disappointment"", Hi-Fi Rush? ""oh its good but its a disappointment"". Meanwhile Forspoken is overhyped and overmarketed, releases broken, is an ACTUAL disappointment, and people are like ""yeah it has problems but its actually better than what everyone says"" Honestly none of you make any sense, terrible journalists, you and the the lot of em.

I even played on lower difficulties because on hard i would have to seek cover and preserve my health and  stuff like that, on lower difficulties i could run around switching weapons doing finishers, using powers, almost DOOM level fun.

Gunplay, the world, the lore had all been fun. It might be just me being used to Fallout's vaults and metro systems but I never got confused. A lot of the problems you listed seems to be more of your own personal taste than the game design itself.

It lives up to its promises and so far, its been quite engaging and fun to play. Its engaging, fast, fun and nothing to really complain about. The problems here are seemingly the little things that I am not bothered by all. 

The reminders? So what. Its the game reminding me. The difficulty settings are pretty straight forward and the game has story, so... don't know the complain with that and you can just run through it all if your really not caring.

Crashing, stairs, I see that. But I don't think I've never not have a time like that in any other game. 

P3 and Charles for me is pretty much good for me. Their no nonsense soldiers out for a duty and something they have to accomplish.

I don't know, these complains are more like your own personal things that you hate rather than actual things that are actually bad about it. Not that I am discrediting you, but it just seems this game isn't for you while for others like ACG, Graythelion, and me. I like it.",2023-02-20T15:58:22Z,1,4

I remember when they first unveiled it, it gave me the impression that it would've been an iconic First Person Survival Horror. That shit was so cool to see.

But now? It is struck with a curse that a lot of modern, single player games keep on carrying: beautiful art direction paired with a heavy narrative and boring, shallow, sad gameplay loop. Atomic literally combines Dying Light's gameplay style with Destiny's power system and shooting. Fucking disappointing but expected.

While other studios come out with a perfect game on their first try, I think that a lot of the QoL issues that you mentioned in the beginning of the review are probably a result of relatively inexperienced devs not considering certain factors. I think because of how visually impressive the game is and how close to a Triple A title this looks and feels, it is easy to forget that this is still an Indie Game, and that they don't have the same level of experience as Triple A studios in giving their games accessibility options.

Regarding your issues with the main character, English isn't their first language (I think), and probably not the language that the game was written in, and so it's likely that a lot of the awkwardness and the narcissism of the protag might be holdovers from the original Russian that didn't translate as well.

TL;DR: Cut them a bit of slack since it is a project by an inexperienced studio that doesn't speak English as their first language. While it's possible for them to do better, I think that with a few tweaks the game can be improved significantly

Real quick thing I want to add, I am aware and appreciate that Mayo is very honest and straightforward with his opinions and states his experiences and frustrations exactly as they happened.

But it does not get that ridiculous until you know what you're doing and where all the good stuff is. Prey has at least two playthroughs, one where you are fumbling about trying to survive an alien occupation. And another where you are a precognitive kelptomaniac who is ready willing and able to make 300 shotgun shells as soon as you get to Psychotronics. 

It's a real shame about Atomic Heart, my brother and I were holding out hope it would be in Prey's league. Especially since his favorite genre of horror is failed Soviet experiments.",2023-02-20T14:23:39Z,21,100

Maybe this will give the sidequest an impact because of your higher consumption of ressources ? Maybe they can mix enemies types in a way that make less sense in the story, caus it seems on what you show that enemies seems to have a role in the facility that they are placed in (except mustache guys, who are everywhere), to focus more on gameplay. It also seems like bosses don't apear in regular encounters (like doom hunter/ marauder from doom, nightmare from prey etc) and it may be a good refresher for the combat (if their health bar is nerfed). 
I think i will not pick this game, at least for now, because i think you searched in atomic heart what i wished it was, and your disapointment will be mine if a play it. Thanks for the well made review, realy covered all the important points and didn't focus only on the negative / positive.
