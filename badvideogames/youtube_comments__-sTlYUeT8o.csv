People might find it insulting and dismissive when people like myself respond to comments and videos with statements like you didn‚Äôt get the game or understand the story being told but here‚Äôs the thing, if you‚Äôre scratching your head at the end of the game questioning why Ellie didn‚Äôt kill Abbey...you didn‚Äôt get the game. You didn‚Äôt understand the story. 

I‚Äôm not by any means biassed or fanboying blindly over the game. I would be the first to call bullshit over flaws or plot holes if I found them. In fact the only issue I have with the story and the thing I call bullshit on, where I consider there to be plot armour is Ellie A being able to go toe to toe with Abbey in the theatre. A normal punch from Abbey would ‚Äúbe neck broken, neck gone‚Äù just like if we were to get a full blown punch from Dwayne Johnson, Arnie in his prime or any other bodybuilder and B the fact that Lev would intervene and stop Abbey from killing Ellie. 

Abbey has more than proved she is a good person, at least to Lev by risking her life to get the medical supplies to save Yara and going through a war zone to save Lev. 

There should be no question over what kind of person Abbey is or disgust or fear about her actions in the theatre since Lev knows how dangerous Ellie and her company are, having just seen the aftermath of what they had done in the aquarium, in fact Lev showed abbey the map to help her find them. Lev knew they weren‚Äôt going there just to talk and knows the kind of world they live in. People must die if they are a threat for the purpose of self preservation.  

Abbey is all Lev has at that moment and Lev would have known that Tommy had been trying to kill Abbey and would've known how dangerous it would be for any of That group to survive. Lev is not Clementine from season 1 of the walking dead Telltale game, Lev knows all too well the ramifications of sparing any of them given that they were able to find the aquarium in 4 days and wipe out the people and dog that Lev had begun to bond with. 

Ellie survives this confrontation because she ‚Äúhad armour and a big fucking sword‚Äù (Sandor Clegane -game of thrones season 4 ep 5)

Abbey experienced that after years of training and obsessing over killing Joel, killing him accomplished nothing. She didn‚Äôt feel better and felt more empty. It wasn‚Äôt the feeling she expected. Those actions led to her losing everyone she considered friends and her love interest in the process(albeit a forbidden love, she cared greatly for Owen and would have died for him). She lost herself like Joel‚Äôs song says. 

Ellie is the other side of the coin and as she withered and wasted away, losing more and more weight, obsessing over her revenge she was losing herself just like Joel‚Äôs song says. 

In her final moments in Santa Barbara she gets it. She gets that killing Abbey won‚Äôt bring Joel back but the pursuit of this and obsession over this has cost her everything, her mum‚Äôs switch blade, her fucking fingers which she needed to even play the song Joel taught her and last but not least, her new family. Not to mention that the version of Abbey she found was not the same person which would have made defeating her all the less fulfilling. For those that saw or remember the scene from ‚ÄúBrotherhood‚Äù when Sam , the guy from the first movie in that trilogy who killed Curtis‚Äôs nephew, breaks Curtis‚Äôs arm and sets him up to go to jail in the sequel and the moment when Curtis catches up to him in the 3rd movie? He sees that Sam is not the same Sam he had been obsessing over. He had been reformed and didn‚Äôt want to continue the cycle of violence and revenge, despite losing his mother through the actions of Curtis in that same movie. 

Same thing here. Ellie went through a journey physically and emotionally and arrived at a realisation.  Killing Abbey,now, achieves nothing, fixes nothing and won‚Äôt even make her feel better about Joel‚Äôs death. 

What matters now, is her family and getting back to them. It‚Äôs something she had to realise by herself. She had to arrive at that point of understanding and it took her going all the way to Santa Barbara and chasing Abbey through Seattle before that to get to that point of understanding. 

She is no longer haunted by her flashes of Joel‚Äôs head being split open, the very vision that led to her travelling to Santa Barbara for revenge, she now remembers him for how he lived and is able to visualise him doing what he enjoyed, playing guitar and it is at that moment she truly forgives him and accepts what he did to save her life back in Utah.

The closest thing that passes for a happy ending in a fucking apocalyptic world with infected monsters and homicidal maniacs. 

Ellie doesn‚Äôt descend into madness, she comes back from her breakdown the way Rick Grimes comes back from losing Lori at the Prison in the walking dead(walking dead proper, the comics, the real Rick Grimes, no offence Andrew Lincoln who was great in a show that was great in season 1 and 2 but declined in quality as the series went on)",2024-08-08T22:17:50Z,2,0

I just wish it was a 3rd installment that did this, and not the direct sequel. I wish the 2nd game dealt solely with Ellie learning what Joel did, and establishing the consequences of that. I feel that‚Äôd make the 3rd game a lot stronger in what they tried to do.

Naughty Dog never wanted us to empathize with Abby. She never wanted us to worry about her. They forced us to play on their side to make us feel uncomfortable. And this is confirmed in the theater scene in which we are forced to fight Ellie. We don't want to do it. We hate doing it. And that's the most impressive thing about this game. No game has ever made me feel like I didn't want to play it on the supposed wrong side. They did it. And that's absolutely brilliant. And the bittersweet ending in which Ellie does not forgive but wants to forgive Joel, drinking coffee on the porch of the house, is the best ending we could have had in the saga.",2024-06-28T21:45:26Z,0,0

Everyone's initial response was just a big knee jerk reaction. I have played it through 5 times now. Sure the pacing could be a bit tighter and some of the choices side characters make are a bit questionable. Both very minor complaints. Everything else is pretty much perfect. Especially the core gameplay loop (steath>gunplay>melee). I think its a 9.5/10. And I totally understand if people give it 10/10. 

The Abby plot doesn't bother me at all. I really enjoy the Wolves vs Scars plot with Lev/Yara. Every time I play it through I find a different piece of paper that teaches me about the world. Or like you how you can hear the Abby fighting the Hospital boss. Its an incredible game.

No I understand why she wouldn't revenge but let's not forget Joe pretty much applied that he was giving that doctor an option if he didn't pick up a knife he would still be alive... Also not to mention that the cure that surgery wasn't 100% guaranteed it's going to save mankind there was a good chance Ellie would have died for nothing... Also when Marlene asked the doctor Abby's father what would you do if it was Abby that was immune he didn't say yes And also he didn't say no to give him credit but he didn't answer the question should that tell you right there Rose will reversed he would have done the exact same thing and my opinion and it's just my opinion Joe did the right thing any father or somebody that you're really close to given that nature of the world and is probably the worst zombie apocalypse that we ever seen and video gave me history given the exact same circumstances we would have done the exact same thing.. now I must admit the last of Us part 2 does have better gameplay and better graphics That's awesome but the story is the one that sells the game and that's the story was a massive disappointment... People like to say that Ellie is the main star which I can understand in a way but Joel was the heart and soul of the last of Us it was basically through his eyes that we played in the original last of Us part 1... In a fictitional world Joe is just a common man but he's one of my favorite characters and I was heartbroken and I can't believe it like I was literally sad that Joel died that early only 5 minutes... Not the whole story of The last of Us part 2 was Ellie getting revenge and then at the end she decides not to what was the point of killing all her friends pretty much doing the exact same way.. Joel did And he killed everybody in that firefight building... It would have been better if they gave the player an option to kill Abby or not I'm not saying that it would have fixed the whole game but it would have been so much better I think then the original is now there's rumors that there's a last of Us part 3 coming out what the hell are they going to do now... You know the best part of the story in the last of Us part 2 is between Abby and Joel in flashbacks,2024-05-10T18:01:53Z,0,3

Its just how they did it. Like why not play as Ellie for the whole game and show off more of the tension between them, have them find common ground again and then have Joel killed off right as they're beginning to like each other again. Like have that be the climax of the story. Don't just have it at the fucking beginning of the game lol.

The game on Grounded difficulty, which is what I always play through the first game on was so difficult, I wasn't having any fun. Where in the first game, you could use various tactics, and strategies to get through situations as long as you managed your inventory well enough. Well in this game, the only tactic I found semi-useful was running in circles around whatever area I was in until Dina killed all the infected because she has unlimited ammo, and encounters with Clickers are basically unavoidable now.

They amplify this in this game, Joel's death is supposed to be rushed in order to add to the shock value and to piss off the player, the game wants you to feel hatred towards Abby (AT FIRST).

It feels sort of childish to not try and play along with what the game is trying to to and just say ""Joel was disrespected""(he wasn't) or ""Idgaf she killed joel"".

I finally played the game and maybe its because i had no expectations with how polarising it was but i thought it was fine.

They're just like these happy, cheerful people, characters you'd get from a kids cartoon or something, in order to manipulate you more and make you feel bad for the other characters actions. So ridiculous. Would have had more respect and believability if they were more dark, gritty, realistic to the world. It just feels like these were definitely not the characters who were organically behind the scenes of the firefly base in the first game. Not at all.

Season 2 will probably resurface all these issues, and once again Bruce will just hide behind excuses like thinking all the criticism is politically motivated, when he cant for once just have some self reflection and maybe see that there is a possibility the script sucks, and the writing is straight up terrible in comparison to the tight and well executed script of the first game.

During the days when social media was starting to seep into our daily lives more and more people hadn‚Äôt become as obsessed with it and the cynical nature of the Internet wasn‚Äôt there yet. People in general used to be very mellow themselves and not take everything they read or see all that seriously besides a few nitpickers here and there. And the last of us part 1 was released in that era where people still had a modicum of optimism left in them.

As the years have gone on and as the Internet has taken over everyone‚Äôs lives at this point, the cynicism and contrarian culture rapidly got a boost with many of these reaction channels being one of the major culprit for that trend and what once was a vocal minority has now become mainstream and thus we have the last of us part 2, a game that actively forces players to play the us vs them game that have become all too standard on the Internet and it has formed a ginormous crack in the player base from which it‚Äôll most likely never recover. 

Whereas the first game was unanimously acclaimed by just about everyone who played it with a few exceptions of course, but even with those exceptions the discourse around was still way better than what it is rn turned into. 

So while people can blame each other or the developers for being too ‚Äúwoke‚Äù, it‚Äôs really the fucking era that we live that‚Äôs the bloody problem. The cynical tyrants have made the online space a battleground for endlessly bullshot debates and it reflects perfectly in the last of us part 2.",2023-10-18T15:19:07Z,0,2

Joel's humanity didn't matter when we were bashing his brains out but alright. And they ram this point straight through your skull - you're just like them! you're just like them! See how we named every NPC you kill? Oh my God you killed Timmy!!! You monster! Yeah I did, and you're fucking next John. I would kill every dumb Wolf they showed me all over again no matter how pregnant or crippled or lesbian they were. These guys went out of their way to come to MY HOME to kill MY DAD (speaking as Ellie but also myself I guess) which was fine when you did it Abby but OK I guess I'm just supposed to bend over for that one. They are NOT the same at all - Abby your dad was a coward that was going to kill a 14 year old girl under the guise of righteousness, but really he was rolling the dice with a kid's life and we all know he would feel so much differently if it were you. It's so insulting how they try so hard to make you believe Joel DIDN'T make the right decision, but let's see who'd gamble their own kids life like that for an off chance of fixing a virus we never even made clear we understand enough to make a vaccine for. And if Joel's decision was wrong, Abby's was straight up diabolical. At least Joel did what he did to save someone. Abby just came in to kill. Aren't we supposed to lecture her for that?

This right here^

People trivialize any criticism of this game as people just not wanting Joel to die or not wanting Abby to be in the story... when it's really just bad writing. What you described sounds *SO* much better and would have been so much easier to establish.

Joel would still be dead, Abby would still be a central character and I would bet money that much more people would have enjoyed it.

Because we would have been able to bond with and sympathize with Abby *BEFORE* she murdered one of the main characters of the first game that we bonded with years ago. Trying to force that empathy down the player's throat hours AFTER the game opened with it was such a stupid move. So manipulative.

Hell, they could have replaced Dina with Abby. Dina's literal ONLY character trait is that she loves Ellie. That's it. And we don't even get a compelling reason as to why, she just does. Have that love interest be Abby and it creates so much more tension when it's finally *revealed* that the revenge plot Abby was on, was literally to kill Ellie's father figure. Does Abby continue with it? How does it affect how Ellie sees Joel? Especially considering Abby never even tells Ellie she killed Joel because of her father in the actual game. No one tells her that. As far as she is concerned, it's  because of the cure BS.",2023-06-28T12:49:30Z,0,7

But it‚Äôs also something quite brilliant: a meditation on humanity, cause and effect, good vs evil, and the futility of good intentions. It‚Äôs not even a video game really at this point so yeah, 6/10 is spot on Joe. But as an experience you‚Äôll never forget, it‚Äôs a 10.

Our idea is pretty similar to yours. We think that this should have been advertised as Abby's game from the beginning. Have us start out playing as her right off the bat. Establish that she's seeking revenge on someone and explain why, but don't reveal who she's hunting down. They could have even left subtle hints as to who she's looking for so the player could attempt to piece things together if they're paying enough attention. Having us play as Abby from the beginning would have given the player a chance to actually grow attached to her and sympathize with her situation. Instead they had Abby kill off a beloved character within the first hour of the game and then forced the player to feel pity for her after the fact. That just doesn't work. The player's opinion on her had already been established the second she killed Joel. However, if they had gotten us to care about Abby before that scene, it would have made for a better conflict. If done right, the player wouldn‚Äôt know who to side with. Then during the middle of the game after Joel has been killed, we would play as Ellie and seek revenge on Abby. Again, the player should feel conflicted on who to side with. I also would have Ellie successfully kill Abby in the end. It would have conveyed the message they were going for so much better. She would have gotten her revenge, but at what cost? She ended up losing everything and she didn't even get the closure she was looking for. There are also a few minor things I would change or cut out completely, but this is mostly just a general idea on how I think this game should have been written.",2023-04-28T21:33:50Z,4,11

How to improve the story:

A girl named Abby is found near the Jackson dam alone, starving, sick, etc. She's taken in and begins working with the community of Jackson and proves her worth as she's nursed back to health. Her and Ellie are eventually put on patrols together and Ellie tries to learn more about Abby and why she was there, and Abby reveals she was a firefly until someone killed the last of them, including her dad. Ellie feels terrible for her, and agrees to join her to find out what happened, considering she also wants to know for sure. They travel to the hospital and Abby finds proof Joel was the one who killed everyone, not telling Ellie. When they return, Abby nearly kills Joel, Tommy finds her in the act, and in a panic, she shoots and kills Tommy when he attacks her. She leaves Joel crippled, in and out of consciousness, and flees Jackson, leaving behind the evidence for Ellie to find. Ellie confronts Joel, bedridden, feeling betrayed for his lie, but he's unable to defend himself properly in his current state. Ellie storms off to hunt down Abby, still angry she murdered Tommy and almost killed Joel, accompanied by Jesse and Dina who mainly want to watch Ellie's back. Cut to Abby who is back in Seattle (or wherever) living in a small group of her close friends, some ex fireflies. The area is filled with infected and bandits, and Ellie finds one of Abby's friends (maybe Nora) she had told her about when they were friends captured by hunters. Ellie and Dina kill the hunters, and just as Nora is thanking them for saving her, Ellie pulls her gun and demands to know where Abby is. Nora refuses to sell Abby out, and Ellie in her chaotic mental state is forced to torture her until she talks, much to Dina and Jesse's horror, but doesn't intend to kill her. Ellie accidentally kills her before she can tell her, sick to her stomach. Dina and Jesse grow further from Ellie, very upset she could do such a thing. Later, Abby and Manny find Nora and the hunters dead, finding one of Ellie's arrows in Nora. Abby and Manny track them down and find where they're staying, bursting in at night. Jesse is startled and quickly shoots on her friend Manny, killing him. Abby, enraged, shoots Jesse in the head. Ellie and Dina run into the room, Abby grabbing Dina and holding a gun to her head. Abby is betrayed and angry at Ellie, hurt she would kill her friends for Joel. Ellie explains her and Joel's relationship, and that she was the one that Joel killed all those people to save, and that she was the one Abby should be angry at. Abby knocks Dina out with her gun, charging at Ellie, enraged, tackling her and beating her in a frenzy. Ellie manages to stab her in the leg, getting her off her. They have a brutal and bloody fight, Ellie eventually gets the upper hand and is about to kill her, when she realizes Dina has come to and is watching her, she completely falls apart and drops her knife. She lets Abby go to tend to Dina, when the last of Abby's friends arrive, ready to shoot Ellie and Dina. Abby however stops them, Ellie and Abby trading a meaningful look before she helps Dina to her feet, and they return to Jackson, never to see one another again, Ellie leaving her knife behind.

Later, Ellie and Dina are leaving flowers at Tommy's and Jesse's graves, Dina still a little cold to Ellie from seeing her so bloodthirsty. She says she's still upset at her for not letting her anger go sooner, and that it caused Jesse to die, but she still cares for her and just needs time, forgiving her. She leaves Ellie alone by the graves, as Joel walks up behind her, looking the worse for wear, and forced to use a cane from the attack. Ellie is still mad at him, but he tries to assure her he was justified in his actions, but at the same time does regret having to kill so many people, and admits if he were in Abby's place, he would do what she did, but that he's proud Ellie stopped before completely losing herself. Joel says he's not proud of his past, but the one good thing that came of all of it and made it worth it was Ellie, and the only thing he wants now is just her forgiveness. Ellie is quiet for a while, Joel afraid she doesn't care about him anymore. She finally gives a small nod, and simply says ""Okay."" Joel wipes his eyes, giving her arm a squeeze as they stand next to eachother facing his brother's grave, and the screen goes black.

Obviously you'd need to add a bunch of padding and whatnot, but I think framing the story away from *only* the violence, the death, the vengeance, into forgiveness and letting go is way more compelling and a more  useful story.",2023-04-03T19:42:17Z,1,2

I put it off for years because of the bad reviews like this. I decided to give it another chance after finishing the first season of the TV show. I usually agree with Joe's critiques, but I have to disagree with him this time. Joel's death didn't have a big epic build up, because it's not supposed to have one. That's how real life is. People are there one second then they're gone. Which happens with other characters in this game too. It's not as theatrical as you might see in movies, but I actually praise the fact that they did it like this. They did Joel dirty and you're supposed to feel like they did him dirty. You're supposed to feel angry, and as the game plays out you start to see the human side in abby and understand her motivations more. There is no good guy or bad guy in this story. Much like real life everyone is in a gray area.",2023-03-26T01:02:55Z,6,2

Even if the game was ‚Äúabout hate‚Äù, it should have revolved around the empathizing emotion of wrath we as humans feel, but should not be servants to, lest we bring more evil into the world. It‚Äôs that empathizing with a parent‚Äôs love for their child that led people to love Joel despite his actions, it was that presentation. Abby & Elly remaining so ‚Äúangry‚Äù at people for no believable reasons through most of the game ruins that empathy factor for the audience. We don‚Äôt feel for them, and end up hating them by the end (which if that‚Äôs the intent, it worked. Whatever.)

Not to mention that unlike the first game, the game almost runs counter to the motif to that message of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt give in to hate‚Äù, having us murder nearly everyone in our way. For Joel, it was a job, and survival for a reason. Here, it‚Äôs literally just wrath-fueled reasoning why it‚Äôs happening, with heaps of bodies in its wake.

I just beat it for the first time yesterday. It's a bit long, but it's far better than the first. I also don't like the excuse everyone uses about Joel's death ruining the game. Even Joe is here complaining about plot armor, but then keeps being upset that Joel dies.... Joe is literally missing his own point. 

I love both versions of Ellie. She's a sweet kid, but growing up in this post-apocalyptic world, where anyone (*cough cough*  Joel) can die any second, has turned her into a monster. She's a justified monster but still a monster. That's what I loved about this game. It shows why people are the way they are. It shows that even in a world consumed by savagery, we're still human and should seek out redemption. 

Abby was a great character. I found my time with her crew to be spectacular. I loved her relationship with Owen so much. I loved that this game made me love both sides in this story and understand their motivation. I've said it since the first game, and I'll say it again for this one. These games are not about heroes. Joel isn't a good man in the first game. Here, neither Ellie nor Abby are good.  They are just human, and that's what I come here for. The story isn't like all other games that just show us a completely good vs. evil story. It's a complex story about human nature. 

I just feel that everybody who hates this game simply just wants two things. 

1. Joel to have lived
2. Abby to die

This is like watching Game of Thrones and being angry that the main characters get killed off every season, getting mad about it, but then continuing to watch it. I love a story where nobody is safe. It adds to the suspense. 

Love your reviews, Joe, but I feel like you got this one all wrong. It's an opinion, so it really can't be wrong, but I feel people are only giving this game negative reviews because the story didn't go exactly how they wanted it. It's a great game with great characters and a spectacular story. It blows the first game out of the water in almost every single aspect.",2023-03-23T14:47:05Z,3,3

Especially reaction to Joel's death was hilarious. Have you never lost someone who was really important person to you? Probably not, and you don't have imagination and empathy to understand what is like and what anger and traumas do to people. And how vengeance looks like, how empty, hateful and senseless it is. And you look for logical explanation of something irrational and emotional. What an idiot. Well, welcome to the real world, important people dies and it's shocking, unexpected and destructive. Game is so awesome in so many aspects and one of my favorites is that it confront stupid, spoiled brats with really heavy reality what makes them... well angry and acting senseless, emotional and illogical (like when you talk how predictable story is and in the meantime shows how angry, surprised and shocked you are when characters die) themselves. This review is a great example of that. If someone wanna see a truly good review there is one on ign. And for a game, it is one of the best ever made, even better than first one with incredible deep, moving, emotional, realistic  story about heavy experiences and ways of dealing with it, relationships, survival, human awful, self-destructive (we all will see in few years when the climate apocalypse come) disgusting, egoistic, virus-like, war-for-nothing nature. Gameplay is like the same as in first part but expanded, better, realistically brutal. All enemies have names, others react when they found out someone of their commrads or closed ones died, with emotions. And screaming of dieing is so real. There is no empty, american, idiotic killing of bots what makes people think that killing is fun. Game gives really different experience (fun and terrifying at once) which i haven't seen in any other, because of this crazy realism. Can't go through this game emotionless, but for some people it gives not the ones they would expect and wish to confront with (look at review up). For most of us life is no disneyland, and for others soon it won't be either. You may treat this game as warning, future is coming",2023-03-19T17:58:14Z,8,2

Part 2 is absolutely disrespectful. I enjoyed season 1 of the tv show but I may stopped watching when season 2 release.  The disrespect to Joel is too much. Part 2 of the game was a woke/feminism release and unfortunately the same effort may show up in season 2 of the tv show. The dynamic of Ellie and Joel was destroyed just to force feed new characters we did not want. AJ did what other reviewers was quiet to say.

I come back to this one just like other angry reviews because it's hilarious. But I love tlou2. I never thought it was ass. I was so emotionally amped up during tjis game. I had to go through the whole hating abbie. And slowly coming to terms with the fact that she's not a bad guy for killing Joel. Joel was the bad guy in her story. Then she became tbe bad guy in ellies story. And then Ellie becomes tbe bad guy in abbies story. So by the end. I was happy she djdnt kill Abby. Because they are all victims in this horrific world. Starting with the death of Sarah. The story was never meant to be some happy ending story at all. It was always a deep dark depressing and emotional story.

The first game worked because it showed us how ambiguous Morality would be in a world ridden by infection and collapse of civilization as we know it, giving rise to a darker impulses of humanity.
Many people died, they didn't deserve it. Many people killed other people, they didn't mean it for the most part. Everyone just wanted to survive so desperately.
So even when we are in situations where characters make morally ambiguous or terrible actions, we aren't trying to defend or rationalize said actions, we just know that it's a shitty world filled with desperate assholes who would do anything to survive. It's a terrible world out there, and if you don't kill, you'd be killed.
The game puts in so much effort for us to understand that Joel is a very flawed person (possessive, vindictive and emotional), so despite us seeing his sometimes drastic and downright evil actions, we don't necessarily condemn him for them, because for the most part, he never suggested he was a good person, or he was right with what he did.
This was what made the story of TLOU1 so memorable. We empathize with these people, knowing that if we were in similar situations, we'd probably do the same.

TLOU 2 takes this moral ambiguity and shoves it out the window. Now it's so much about shock value, guilt, and moral lessons.
Instead of trying to make this game at least a little bit like the original, they just were focused on distinguishing between right and wrong, and how ""senseless killing isn't a good thing"", or how ""revenge is a terrible thing"" (No brainerüòí).
 We've seen these tropes in movies, TV shows and video games and it's been done to hell.

Using the aforementioned things to replace an already bleak world filled with moral ambiguity and darkness, just doesn't work.

All this coupled with the inconsistency in character development and plot armour devices, with the ridiculous and pointless ending, I have no idea what Naughty Dog was trying to do.

Actually, now that I think about it, they weren't trying to do anything unique. It was all about shock value more than anything else. They obviously didn't give a shit about the writing.

So anyone can say whatever they want, the game doesn't suck because of Abby or the introduction of LGBTQ characters, or the politics about it.
It's just the subversion of what made the original so well, by click baiting and clich√© shock values.",2023-03-02T08:54:16Z,11,1

Death doesn't wait for anybody. It can happen at any moment. Joel's death is no different. There are no good people in that world. Tess even said they were shitty people in part 1. One more thing, Joel got too trusting because of years of peace between the end of Part 1 and the start of Part II. As one great philosopher said, ""Victory has defeated you"". Only thing that bothered me was midway through the game in my first go-around, I had to to re-start with Abby. Felt like damn, I gotta do this from day one again.

Probably gonna get hate for saying this, assuming anyone still dwells this comment section and cares enough to give me hate. But I really do think Joe was biased here. Not claiming he's transphobic or homophobic or anything like that, just hear me out. Listen to alot of Joe's complaints. Not all are invalid (in fact none of them are because it's a subjective review, but you know what I mean,) some are pretty fair criticisms and some I even agree with. But this video, and future content about the last of us franchise regarding the HBO adaptation, always find ways to return to ""Joel died and that upsets me."" He criticizes the sex scene with Abby, and fair enough, it's unnecessary and there's plenty to mock (even though I personally don't mind it.) But his first comment is ""I don't know, I mean, Abby killed Joel..."" he finds a way to bring it back to Joel's death instead of criticizing the actual scene or anything that happens in it. What about his major complaints by the end? ""Every character that I want to see is either broken or dead."" It seems much less like he's criticizing the story for its quality and more so because it's an upsetting story. This has become even more apparent in his recent last of us videos. When talking about Neil Druckmann's comments on changing events from the game his first reaction is ""maybe the thing with Joel doesn't need to happen."" Literally saying ""well why can't he live till the end?"" Alex on the other hand actively criticizes writing and execution rather than content, and while I believe that some of those arguments are in bad faith or disingenuous, I think he's still much less salty than Joe about Joel not making it out alive. It also speaks volumes that most of the criticisms regarding the cinematic action sequences apply to the first just as much as this one. The discussions of ploy armor, unlikely solutions, villains not killing characters for some reason. The penultimate chapter of Part 1 has examples just as prevalent, or the scene where Ellie's secret is revealed to Joel and Tess, or the giant armored truck and all its chases, or when Ellie is literally being held down on a table with a knife to her neck and for some reason the captors believe what was 99.9% likely to be a bullshit story, or the final chapter where they don't execute Joel despite knowing he's incredibly capable, angry, and threatening them, and countless more. All these criticisms apply to the first game just as much as the second. But the second was an upsetting story, so everything that was ignored in the first is suddenly a problem. And I do believe for a lot of people, including Joe, their major issue is Joel's death. It brought out mounds of bias in reviewers, and Joe was not an exception. Probably gonna get hate, but that's what I've noticed and what I believe personally.",2023-02-21T03:11:38Z,4,3

It‚Äôs not until looking after Lev and actually doing something selfless that she begins to be at peace now seeing her dad normally in her dreams. Also karma seriously bites her ass from Nora, Owen, and Mel getting murdered so no she doesn‚Äôt get off scot-free but that‚Äôs still somewhat debatable with the ending.

I do wonder, though, if the series will try to follow Part 2?
In a way I could see it, particularly if they can't afford Pedro Pascal for multiple seasons (but this is HBO, so they should be rolling in dough).

Also, there could be scheduling conflicts that would make it easier to kill him off (another season of The Mandalorian, and who knows what else).

Their best bet would be to ignore Joel's death though, or maybe pull a 'bait and switch' and make us think he is dead (but if we don't see a body, we KNOW we will see him again eventually).",2023-02-03T18:09:16Z,0,0

*SPOILER ALERT*


*SPOILER ALERT*


*SPOILER ALERT*


     While replaying Last of Us 2, I think I came up with a good change they should implement to not make Joel seem so reckless. I think when Abby first gets saved by Joel, Tommy should be on the other side of the big truck that was there (or anything that can block his view) on his way running running toward Joel, and since he hears Joel shooting, he screams: ‚ÄúYou alright Joel?!‚Äù 

     Thinking about it probably more profoundly than I should, if I lost sight of my brother while he was heading toward infected and he starts shooting, I‚Äôd be concerned enough to let his name slip out if I‚Äôm in the moment. It makes more sense to me than them saying it later. Abby can remember this later on, and then proceed to ask about it on the spot once they‚Äôre in her friends‚Äô safe cabin/house. Since they‚Äôre on the spot, Joel looks at Tommy in a hesitant way and disappointed that she heard her name, but realizes that what‚Äôs done is done and it makes no sense to lie now. So they look at each other like they‚Äôre willing to take the risk, and Joel nods by tilting his head sideways while almost rolling his eyes and then Tommy says: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Tommy, this is Joel.‚Äù Idk why, but I feel like this would solve how this part doesn‚Äôt make any sense. 

     If you want to go deeper with an alternate scenario you can even have Ellie and Dina catch up to the cabin while this conversation takes place and becomes way more of an intense situation. Maybe let them fight and let Joel go out with a bang. He can take out other people who are extra WLF members that traveled with Abby‚Äôs group. Before this, you can have them elaborate on why they want to kill Joel and include more exchanged dialogue about it between the several characters involved (More tension between Joel and Ellie).

    I think this scene is what mainly bothered a lot of people about the game since it wasn‚Äôt logical enough. How is it that I could come up with something that makes more sense to me in 5 minutes? That‚Äôs why it bothers me so much at least. Am I alone? Am I the Last of Us to agree?",2023-01-31T14:31:44Z,0,0

The series to me is like a Shakespearian tale where the message is so much bigger than the characters. This game wasn‚Äôt Joel‚Äôs game, it‚Äôs a message of right and wrong, forgiveness, the pointless of rage and revenge. Angry joe is supposed to feel this way about Joel‚Äôs death because it adds depth to Abby‚Äôs character. I actually really like Abby, I mean could you imagine some guy killing your dad and destroying the vaccine to humanity, you get revenge a few years later then Ellie, killing ALL OF YOUR FRIENDS like EVERYONE THAT YOU LOVE. You have to feel for her. And that‚Äôs what the games all about - learning to empathise with your enemy that you have so much hatred for",2023-01-26T11:40:59Z,4,6

The goal was to upset people. It made plenty of people angry, but that was kind of the point, making the video game equivalent of The Road and being all miseryguts all the time. We can argue for hours about whether Joel is a good person or not. Or if he was justified. Or whatever. It stands that Joel killed countless people and faces minimal consequences because consequences aren't fun. The sequel was designed to be a gut punch. Feel free to argue if that's a good thing or not, that's incredibly subjective. As it stands, this story was designed to be about dragging real world morality and punishment into a game-ified setting, something that Part 1 severely lacked. People wanted the adventures of Joel and Ellie 2. They wanted Part 1: 2. Not Part 2. Joel is endeared to the player because he's a loveable character, but we can't ignore the fact that part of that attachment comes from viewing the world through Joel, the lens of the protagonist. We would still love him as an NPC, but not as much because we do not experience the world through him. This is the same reason that people are so comfortable sweeping Joel's murders under the rug with minimal thought dedicated to reasonably justifying him. People are upset that the story does not have the same feel as the first. Which is understandable, but I don't think it's enough to call it terrible. I do not watch something like The Road and walk away bitter because certain characters, arguably far more innocent than those in this world, do not make it out alive. This is a miserable story about miserable people. The first was a miserable story about finding your own joy at whatever cost. I don't believe this game is perfect, far from it. And it's certainly not as good as the first. But I really do think this game is great. I love it, and I will defend it to the moon and back. But never once will I claim it's better than the first. Simply my analysis, it's not an objective one, but it's mine, and I stand by it.",2023-01-26T01:32:52Z,8,2

See her flawed character cohort fuck up a bunch, but also pet the dogs. And THEN we see them meet up with Ellie and Joel. Think ""Oh, this is where they make the character arc into more likable characters"" and then have the horror of realizing that these characters aren't going to be redeemed and they kill Joel. No more pet the dogs, these people are now villains. Then Ellie descends on them as a cycle of violence. Some of the bigger assholes, you cheer as Ellie brutalizes them. Some of the more redeemable ones, you have the conflicted feelings. And at the end, you have a CHOICE whether to kill Abby or not.",2023-01-25T21:39:54Z,1,2

I had a ton of fun playing The Last of Us II. 
Was the story good? It wasn't perfect but it also wasn't awful. 
The gameplay was amazing and I had fun the whole time. 
I understand the criticism around the generic story about revenge, but I still don't feel like it is bad enough to warrant the hate this game gets. 
There's a lot of things that I would have done differently narrative wise if I were naughty dog, but at the end of the day I honestly can't say Last of Us II was a bad game. 
Bad story telling? Sure for this game, but they left so many cliff hangers and unanswered questions they could go anywhere with the franchise in the future.

I never played the first one or this but I feel for AJ, Abby is like Negan from the walking dead just done poorly when I first saw Negan. I loved him I was upset he killed characters we loved but unlike Abby he was introduced through time and not it the face, if this idiots who made this game need good story telling advice for a antagonist but one that becomes good Just look at negan, seriously instead of a bat Abby uses a Golf club but it wasn‚Äôt done well unlike Negan who had a reason to kill(won‚Äôt mention who he kills) characters we loved was to show his power and authority that‚Äôs why Negan is my favorite character, ( I am still on season 7)  Negan is made to be hated in a way but we love cause he is funny and creepy at the same time.",2023-01-11T07:24:06Z,0,1

I absolutely enjoyed all Abby's game setpieces... The trauma hospital... The Hotel section (with Levy)... those in particular come to mind. If Joel lived in LOU2, what would have been his role?

Personally, I feel this game - TLOU Part 2 - packs an emotional punch like a ton of bricks. Together with The Witcher 3, it's my favorite game of all time  and a 10/10. Although a certain character dies, that character is STILL in the game throughout - in memory, flashbacks and a kind of ""moral guidance"" almost. It's like the spirit of the person is still there. I have to commend the writers for taking risks in this way and showing how DEADLY this world is with important characters dying shockingly. You can never predict what will happen in this game... Absolutely top quality writing. Secondly, the fact of having 2 protagonists and you feel for them both and empathize for both cause neither are bad people actually and yet they're against each other because of fate - is totally incredible... The game had me on the edge of my seat. It's a game showing the cost of seeking revenge,  and it's ultimately about redemption.

I thought after waiting so long maybe I should try the game and the story would make sense with all the context, so I am almost done with the game and I am actually even more mad, why? Well for one the game is gorgeous, one of the best looking games and it feels amazing and the animations and acting is great. But the story is SOOOOO convoluted and a complete mess. its got no structure and constantly uses manipulation techniques to make you feel sympathy for so many characters. This is the first time a story has actually hurt a game when the gameplay and graphics are almost perfect (well gameplay isn't perfect but it is very polished). Joe hit the nail on the head with his criticisms, Neil Druckman literally used his feminist agenda and personal political opinions in this game and NO ONE challenged him on it and the result is this dumpster fire of a story. The critics are pure cowards to give this perfect scores when this story is completely clich√© and a complete narrative mess. The game could be a 10 out 10 if the story was actually decent but there is no way this is above a 8 at best.",2022-12-20T23:23:30Z,1,3

It was released in 2013. The stealth and action mechanisms give moment after moment that seem like they should be scripted yet are fully dynamic.

2. No reason to catch feelings. It's just a game and behind it, a story.
3. If it was about Joel & Ellie again, you would complain about it being the same as the first.
4. The game takes time to explain to us why Abby did what she did which is exactly what u would do to someone who killed ur fam.
5. Game still serves us with many Joel memories so he's still in the picture.
6. I guess u play as Elly even more than Abby so I don't see any reason to whine.
7. When someone is killed u don't want, when they aren't u complain the game saves them???
8. Game is still biased towards Elly in the first and second fight scene and she wins. Lots of movies have had the protagonist not killing the villain. Captain America, Black Panther etc. so why think there was not point for the revenge if she didn't kill Abby? 
9. Eagerly waiting for part 3.
10. I agree with most of ur reviews but on this, I totally disagree.",2022-10-18T21:16:22Z,2,4

The fact that people hate it so much shows how good it is. Lesson learned reality is shit and doesnt care about your feelings and reality is also that the director dont give shit what you think and hes just sits in his couch laughing on adult boys screaming. Take it as it is or dont. thats why people are so emotional and critical because they have expectation where everything would have at least a good ending. Its a freakin game.

Abby, other than avenging her fathers death and the firefly's, was emotionally stronger than in ways then Ellie and came to forgiveness earlier than her.

Not that I didn't like him, I'm just not even remotely surprised that someone wanted to kill him out of revenge.  Never really hated Abby either, I just saw her as another Ellie.

Funnily enough, I found Abby's story more interesting anyways, other than the great flashbacks, Ellie's was just about senseless revenge.  Maybe Game of Thrones desensitized me to beloved characters dying off, maybe knowing from the start that Joel was going to die prepared me for it, Idk.",2022-10-09T06:16:34Z,2,0

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-sTlYUeT8o,The Last of Us Part II - Angry Review,2020-07-02T02:32:07Z,@0subsWith0vidsChallenge,I agree with this review 100%. The gameplay mechanics were way better than in the first one but when it came to the gameplay scenarios I only enjoyed Ellies. Abby's sections were all incredibly boring to play. In the first game the only parts I kind of had issues with were the sewers and beggining. I think Neil took a huge gamble with the story. Its clear what he was trying to do and had it gone right this would have been a very solid game. Getting rid of Joel like that was not a very good way. Joel never trusts anyone and I doubt he would have told Abby his name like that or that tracking people would be that easy.,2022-09-22T01:04:09Z,0,5

The writing was atrocious. Joel even doubted himself in the beginning, it makes no sense. 

To see a bunch of weird kids running around the woods where there are hordes of zombies and greet them warmly and introduce them to your family and where you live? The first thing he would have done is pull a gun on them if it was the joel from last of us 1, it would come naturally We even see him do it! the truth is they just wanted to rush this game out and it shows. 
People are not mad that joel died because it was inevitable frankly, it‚Äôs the way they did it. Just to push their cheap little virtue signaling agenda with a very generic revenge story at best. I found it hard to play this game, it felt like a chore Hours and hours of walking and cinematics, milking it for as long as they can only for it to completely disappoint. Terrible writers 100%",2022-09-21T20:19:27Z,5,14

Joel was a very selfish person throughout his time before Ellie. The first game he talks about how he ambushed others like the ones in Pittsburgh, and Tommy talked about how it gave him nightmares because compared to Joel, Tommy is a helpful person and cared about people. Joel didn‚Äôt ever since he lost Sarah. So in comes Ellie. Joel becomes attached to Ellie and by the end of the end of the first game he saves Ellie because he doesn‚Äôt want to lose a daughter again. So this brings it to the scene where Joel tells Ellie the truth. He loses Ellie because of his selfish ways. So during the two years of her basically being distant from him. He learned to be selfless and more trusting in this world cause when he was selfish he lost those he cared about in this world. So this brings me to the ending. When Ellie sees Abby hanging she sees it that Abby is broken and was tortured for months leaving her to believe that that was in a way worse than death so she cuts Abby down and as Ellie was prepared for Abby to attack instead Abby went over to help Lev because Abby learned to be selfless because being selfish made her lose everything. So as they‚Äôre walking to the boats Ellie has a flashback and doesn‚Äôt want to let Abby go. So, Ellie is willing to kill Lev someone who has nothing to do with Joel‚Äôs death just so Abby would fight her. As Ellie realizes she lost everything because of her selfishness in this world just as Joel lost her due to his she finally decides to let Abby go cause she sees that killing Abby would be killing a protector to Lev like Joel was to Ellie and she saw how much Abby cared about Lev, and it for the first time made her see a different side of Abby.",2022-08-30T06:32:28Z,1,0

That‚Äôs the same reaction Abby had when Joel killed her father. People severely missed the point as to why Joel had to die. It‚Äôs not just to say ‚Äúrevenge is bad.‚Äù It‚Äôs to show the player that what Joel did sucked for Abby as much as it sucked for the player to have Joel killed. Nevertheless, both games are severely overrated and formulaic. You can extrapolate the entirety of Joel and Ellie‚Äôs relationship 2 minutes after they meet and it does not deviate in the least. The ending of The Last of Us was predictable to anyone that has read any classic book. Both are 8/10s.

Abby's character can be summed up with this: ""Big like ox, smart like street post."" And even then, I think I might be insulting the poor street post. The only characters in Abby's story I gave any kind of shit for were Lev and Yara only to have the game rip one of them away from me, and even then, I just wanted to get back to playing as Ellie.

I actually cheered for Clickers when they killed Abby.

EDIT: Something I discovered about Abby that really annoyed me, is the utter WASTE of her voice actress, Laura Bailey. She has done so many fantastic roles so well, and then here she is playing such a bland and uninteresting character. She voice acts for 2 seperate MMOs, WoW and Star Wars the Old Republic for crying out loud, even voicing one of the most beloved characters in SWTOR: Kira Carsen.",2022-08-17T23:45:01Z,0,5

In a world where the choices you make might not seem to be a big impact on others, some will come back to haunt you. Joel decided to kill that doctor in the first game which in turn had a toll on Abby. Even though we adored Joel as a character, in the end the best characters will have to make good and bad decisions. Ellie is of course going for revenge, after all Joel was a second father to her. I think Abby‚Äôs look was created that way because of the times we live in. Transgender was a hot topic and they created a hulking female to appeal to certain audiences, but also this game has 2 strong female leads which took over the strong male characters dominating a lot of games. The huge problem with the Abby character is that she wasn‚Äôt in the first game and killed a character that we grew to love so we couldn‚Äôt care about her. Abby needs revenge for her dad being killed which crates Ellie needing revenge for Joel being killed. In the end they understood that they were both on the same path to their own destruction and settled their differences. Ellie took away all the people that were close to Abby as Abby took away one of the closest persons to Ellie. There was really nothing left for each of them at the end and they decided it was time to look for a way to rebuild themselves instead of living with regrets and grief. Either way, the gameplay was on another level.",2022-08-13T14:15:50Z,3,2

All of the things you pointed out of hating the game where exactly why I loved it. It questions your morality and ability to empathize with humans who are in the grey of being people. Joel was honestly a horrible person; he took so many lives and ruined a societies chance to rebuild to save one individual who didn't even want to be saved. In many aspects he got what was coming to him. He died cause Ellie is the main character of the (i think) trilogy, so his entire character was just character building for her. And of course, the ending was unsatisfying, depression, lost, emotional pain and emptiness are generally unsatisfying feelings. If you hate discovering those uncomfortable emotions in your media, then don't consume it.",2022-07-29T06:57:01Z,6,4

Sure bad things happened to characters I loved from the first game. Sure things happened that hurt and were against my wishes. But it takes quite the ego to be upset over a work of fiction because ""ThInGs diDN't gO thE WaY I waNTed"". I feel like Joes (As well as many others players) hurt feelings over the plot & characters blinded him from a lot of great subtle writing. For example the fact that Ellie didn't pick up the Vita is a subtle nod to her no longer being a child but a broken adult. It was not inconsistent writing.

I just haven't been able to find any games that fill the void I feel. I went back to one of my favorite games ""The Last of Us"". Beat it and was immediately depressed because I realized that That  was the end of it for me. In my mind there is no part 2. I waited 7 years to play with the dynamic duo I fell in love with just to be emotionally tortured for hours or days. I honestly don't know what was worse, being forced to play a character I absolutely despised for hours,  being forced down my throat how she was a  good person by some shitty writing, Or having to watch them get their cheeks clapped when I just wanted to complete the cycle of hatred. I had to rewatch this, even after years, it still hurts. Neil Druckmann criticized the people who spoke out against this game and labeled them as haters or trolls.

What surprised me the most was how playing and getting to know Abby made me completely change how I feel about her character. Abby as a person is more sympathetic and easier to relate to than Ellie. And this is coming from someone who loved Ellie from the first game. Naughty Dog really made fantastic use of perspectives to deliver a nuanced, one of a kind gaming experience. I also appreciated the diversity and representation this game brings. My favorite interactions were between Abby and Lev. Of course the flashbacks of Joel and Ellie were memorable as well.

Killing the friends and man that Abby is in love with is indeed Revenge. Revenge is a dead Woman's Game so I guess beating the Abby until she is at the last inch of her life is just the best way to defeat her if you really think about it. The Last of Us 2 is only deemed a great story by the people who are strong enough to stomach it. I for one take it for what it is, A Tragedy nothing more...",2022-07-01T23:46:44Z,0,1

The main topic Cordyceps is only a secondary topic. It seems to have been more important to the creators to do enough justice with their penchant for diversity and the topic of revenge is so old-fashioned and exhausted. Especially if the revenge is not accomplished, it just makes the end customer look stupid. I'm not like others who hate the second part. It was even fun to go with Abs and Lev too. It just lacks size. The size, compactness, the perfect story, the humor, the interaction of the characters Joel and Ellie from Part 1 is simply not reached.",2022-07-01T13:21:46Z,1,14

I'm actually not too butthurt about Joel being given a quick and anti-climactic death either. It's definitely believable in such a world. But agreed, it came way too early and with zero context, it was a total waste. Abby's story being introduced halfway through was fine. I did end up caring about her character, and more specifically the consequences of her actions that ultimately affected all her friends. I agree there were many issues (which I was fine with), but the biggest one was just the order of events in the storytelling. The exact same plot points told correctly could have been good. Nowhere near the first game, but still good.

I'm not as disappointed or mad as most other fans. We got more Ellie and Joel, albeit not enough and so many missing stories. We also got more of TLOU's world - Wolves, Scars, and the little spark of genius that was Yara and Lev's story. I still enjoyed the game, including its horribly out of order storytelling. I can also accept that they dropped the ball. I'm definitely sad that this is most likely how we say farewell to Ellie and Joel as a duo, but nothing was ever going to top the first game anyway. Hopefully they learn from this mistake if they decide to make a third game. And in that same vein, hopefully the HBO show adaptation does Part II correctly if it's successful enough to get there.",2022-06-29T05:06:35Z,0,0

I can understand if people don't like the story, but saying this game is bad just because you don't agree with some plot points doesn't make sense to me. The gameplay has some of the most brutal and intense combat scenarios and amazing stealth mechanics. The graphics are superb. The animations all look great. The music is amazing. The voice acting feels genuine. And the story, whether you love or hate its direction, is extremely emotional. My only gripe would be the pacing. I agree that they could have better intertwined Ellie and Abby's stories to make it feel like less of a drag at the halfway point in the game.

I'm both Gay and Trans so there's no bigotry behind my hate for this game. All the Gay and Trans stuff WAS genuinely well written. It was perfectly integrated and handled well....I just disliked everything else so much. The game is just dogshit. Gameplay (not bad, just mediocre), story, pacing, dialogue, everything. It's a fuckin 2/10 for me and I never want to see a sequel to TLOU ever again if Niel Druckmann is a part of it. This is GoT S8, TLJ and RoS levels of shit writing.

DOOM Eternal will forever be my 2020 GOTY. It's a damn shame that even it's music got robbed by TLOU2 (like every other game). Saying that TLOU2s original soundtrack is the best is an insult. It's the same music as the first game, and no, Joel's song does not count! That's a Pearl Jam song, the best song in the track wasn't even theirs. It's a cover of a better musicians song.

I can't believe that Rockstar, CD Project Red and Naughty Dog are where they're at right now. They were the giants. My fav devs are all now Techland, FromSoft, and Respawn. They may be smaller but they have so much more passion and talent. They actually give a shit.",2022-06-06T23:28:43Z,0,10

When I finished the story, I was like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs it?‚Äù (the game itself was the opposite, I felt it dragged on too long), and was waiting in vain for the story to justify itself, but it never did. It felt like the purpose of the narrative was to basically ruin the lives of every one of its characters, and while that may work in something like 1984, it just makes this game feel overly bleak and sad. You know those cartoon episodes that want to wreck their characters‚Äô lives for the sake of a gimmick (The Simpsons ‚ÄúBoys of Bummer‚Äù, anyone?)?

Just so angry for these amazing characters and the interesting world, all of which seemed to take a back seat for the - in my opinion - pretentious moral message it tried to portray.

I'm back here because a friend of mine recently finished a stream of her first play through, and I actually got very upset watching the ending the second time. Now, without the initial anger, I was able to finally see just how goddamn grim Ellie's ending was - if this is indeed her ending. She's alone (the thing she feared the most), broken, traumatised, can't even play the guitar (her last connection to Joel) and to top it off; the very last flashback of their relationship heartbreakingly reveals that Ellie had wanted to try and forgive him for what he did. And that they never got the chance. This little girl that I fought so hard to protect and loved so much in the first game ... it was just so relentlessly fucking sad.¬†

How could they have expected me to enjoy that? And if I wasn't supposed to - which just doesn't make sense from a game/sales/immersion point of view - why would I ever want to come back to this franchise again afterwards?",2022-05-25T12:14:52Z,24,206

It amazes me how many people were hurt because they didn't get the story that THEY wanted. Actually, i remember when everyone rushed to metacritic to trash the game, about an hour post-launch, which means they haven't even played it. That alone says a lot about our community.
Personally, I'm just happy that Neil is doing his thing man, i think he has been invaluable to the gaming industry all these years and same goes for this team, who have all worked their butt off to deliver this gem.

P.S. Even if you don't like the story and considering the ""competition"" in this particular genre, giving this game a 6/10 as a ""critic"", is a really good way to attract more attention to the channel.",2022-05-22T01:33:31Z,26,5

But I just hate how naughty dog lied to us with the trailer making it seem like it was gonna be another Joel and Ellie story.,2022-05-05T17:01:10Z,0,0

1) Kill Ellie, well, fuck that, i'm out 
2) Send Ellie on another quest for blood, well, fuck that, Ellie is done with that for sure, this makes no sense
3) Make somebody else the main character, well, fuck that, I cant go around and just have Ellie as a lifeless NPC 
4) Ellie reconciles with Dina and happy ending, well, fuck that, (I mean, that's fine, but that is not a game we play, that is maybe a short DLC ME3 style)... 
5) Life in Jackson, defending Jackson from ""the horde"", well, another zombie shooter...

The fact that the writers try to foist a thoroughly unappealing, man-woman on us, instead of giving us what we wanted, you know, more Joel and Ellie, is a deal breaker.

I haven't played the game since my first playthrough when it was first released, so found my old FB review to remined myself why I disliked this game so much.

Just finished The Last of Us Part 2 on PS4

I don‚Äôt care that the critics gave it a 10/10 and called it a masterpiece, because simply put, they‚Äôre wrong!
Never have I played a more bleak, depressing and horrible game, a game that beats you over the head time and time again with guilt and consequence of actions that you can‚Äôt possibly avoid, you can‚Äôt avoid because the game doesn‚Äôt give you that option. 
The action and graphics are exceptional, the brutality and gore doesn‚Äôt hold back at all..
But it‚Äôs the confusing or just plain bad story, it‚Äôs the political correctness that seems entirely out of place and forced, it‚Äôs the moral guilt trip for the entirety of the second half of the game, a second half that feels like you're starting the game all over again but with some hateful female Hulk clone that lets it down so badly. 

Part 1 is my favourite action/adventure/horror game of all time, that in my opinion actually was a masterpiece as far as story telling in a computer game goes. Part 2? Self righteous rubbish that leaves a lingering nasty taste in the mouth, as well as uneasy dose of depression.
If you loved the original as much as I did, and you still haven‚Äôt had the chance of playing the new one, you‚Äôve been warned.",2022-03-28T14:18:00Z,29,4

Was THAT the point.  If so fuck that message.  That people do terrible things for good reasons  or understandable reasons was the lesson we learned in the last game but at the very least  Joel did what he did in self defense and in defense of Ellie. ABBY'S FATHER would have been a murderer however well intentioned Her grief does not justify causing Ellie suffering because her grief was caused by actions her father namely was responsible for in the first place. So no I don't forgive Abby I don't like what they did to Ellie and abandoning the greater plot or story to  avenge some random doctor's death at the end of the first game.  Killing Joel and Traumatizing Ellie (whom already has suffered enough) is literally taking something you love and bashing it to death with a golf club and being asked to empathize with the feelings of the person whom did it yeah no sale.  The whole game is a bad dream in my view As corny as it would be to have a third game have Joel wake up from a nightmare I'd honestly prefer that nonsense to what they chose to do,2022-03-19T15:12:29Z,14,4

People whine because they didn't get the story they wanted. These characters told their own story and you know what? Real life sucks.

Not to mention that the ending was very strange and disappointing to me. I expected Ellie to find Abby and perhaps look for the fireflies to sacrifice herself for making the vaccine a meaningful and satisfying ending at least.

The way HOW the story was told in terms of structure, pacing, execution and character writing were all extremely poorly done.

The problem with the game is that is made for degenerates that support idiotic beliefs and just play for the pew pew. Its a base for love to the gay rights, Asian exist, black people in love and a woman that has huge arms which is the bad guy for good reasons. Not to mention the cringe parts when you play Ellie as mommy or daddy to a baby (not explained very well which one of the two is the woman in the relationship) that takes 20 minutes of your life and i am sure that even gay people hated it.",2022-02-08T12:51:42Z,1,3

While I agree that the content (i.e. plot/story decisions) is hard to digest, my real issue with this game is the aggressive political agenda that was injected into it. Sometimes it seems like people unfairly attack the game's writing as a proxy of sorts, because they feel they can't speak out publicly against the preachy gender politics without coming under fire themselves. Taking a stance against political correctness is controversial. But nobody has a problem if you attack bad writing. I just don't agree that the writing is bad here.
There is a difference between bad writing and having an unpopular event in the plot of a story. In the Game of Thrones book, the ""Red Wedding"" scene was shocking because they killed off a major protagonist. But most people would agreed that the book wasn't badly written. In my view, it's the same situation here. Yes, I also hated to see Joel go. And I wish they had taken the whole story in a completely different direction. But that doesn't make the writing bad.",2022-01-25T12:11:26Z,4,0

Mainly because he's a fictional character. But how I see it is LOU is Joel's game with side Ellie story. LOU2 is Ellie's game with Abby side story. Maybe a little too much Abby but that's neither here nor there. Making you hate her and then see her life through her eyes and understand why she did/does what she did - that's good story telling. Hate what naughty dog did to Joel all you want but you can't deny they know how to tell a story.,2022-01-19T10:38:25Z,0,2

You start the game off as Abby, and you play through most of the same sections that she does in the final game in the first half. But during Abby's sections she should meet Ellie and the two of them become a good team. Because you start off with Abby's chapters you would already know about her dad and how she wanted revenge on Joel, but Abby doesn't find out that Ellie has a connection with him until later on. Eventually you start to play as Ellie, and during these chapters is when Abby learns about Ellie and Joel, and finds a way to get Ellie to convince Joel to trust her. Once she's earned Joel's trust, she can effectively back him into a corner and question him, which she's then faced with the difficult choice of sacrificing her friendship with Ellie in order to take her revenge, or to let it go because she's realized that Joel isn't that bad of a person and she doesn't want to lose Ellie as a friend. Abby ends up making the choice to kill Joel, and this could probably all be done while Ellie watches after maybe being ambushed by some of Abby's other friends, which would explain why we're seeing this during Ellie's section. Seeing this happen is what makes Ellie go after Abby and start her revenge mission. We can then play through Ellie's chapters like normal without all of Abby's stuff in the way of it all. Eventually, just like in the final game, Ellie finds Abby and fights her like normal, but the player is given the choice to either kill Abby or to let her go, which would be a much more difficult decision because we started off as Abby and therefore didn't carry a grudge against her the entire time. Of course there would be some other minor changes throughout the story, a big thing being rewriting Tommy to not be so careless all of a sudden, but this would make for a much better game overall.",2022-01-14T21:56:39Z,151,848

Helping to grown their bond together, build trust, make us care for Abby as a character. She continues on her journey and some time passes. Towards the end, she discovers what Joel did, gets engulfed in hate, gets her team, kidnaps Joel and just as she's about to shoot him BOOM the game ends. Then an epilogue scene where Ellie discovers that something's wrong, she gets on her horse, the camera zooms in on her face as she's riding fast and it fades away with ""The journey will come to and end"" writing.

I mostly disliked the flashbacks and pacing, it was an ok (potentially great) idea and story but I think but they took it too far. I remember after Part 1 my friends and I had a debate if Joel was was a piece of shit and deserved to die, I think people forget the rawness and brutality of Part 1's ending over time, but it made sense because of the whole game that proceeded it, so his death didn't not make sense and was deserved, I guess people feel differently about Joel which is what makes him a great character.",2022-01-02T16:47:36Z,1,4

First of all, Joel dying was a way to fuel rage to let you know what type of game this was about to become. At first when that happened, whenever it came to the Abby segments I was like no fuck this bitch. Then it came to the part of her story after she was in the theater. First of all the parts in her story wasn‚Äôt to make you like her, they were there so you can see the background to the the person you were hunting the entire time and their motive to why they did what they did. The second thing I want to mention is Abby didn‚Äôt get all the attention nor did she get these amazing weapons (yeah they were there because her play style was more brutish hints why Ellie was based more in stealth combat) that being said there were things that Ellie had that Abby didn‚Äôt (an actual good bow and a permanent shiv). When I started going through Abby‚Äôs story it‚Äôs not that I became more invested in her but I started to see why she is doing what she is and what she‚Äôs going through. Ellie‚Äôs mindset was revenge (because of obvious reasons) while Abby‚Äôs was to survive. This whole discussion that I‚Äôve heard so far is why is this game like this and not like the first one? Because why make a continuation to something that was already perfectly executed? I already know Ellie‚Äôs side in all of this and if I were to sit and play this game only to continue that thought, well it wouldn‚Äôt have been exciting. When You were playing as abby in the theater attacking Ellie m first thought was ‚Äúno, please don‚Äôt make me kill Ellie‚Äù and that thought put me on the edge the entire time. Then once I played as Ellie and freed abby and Lev I was sitting there thinking ‚Äúplease do not make me kill abby, she‚Äôs been though enough‚Äù and once that fight broke out I was highly upset. Not in a bad way but I‚Äôm an actual ‚Äúdon‚Äôt make me do this‚Äù type of way. Then once Ellie had that memory of Joel come to mind she let her go. At that point I felt the emotions she was going through. There‚Äôs more to what I want to say but honestly this game was fantastic for what it was. It was never about to make you love this new character, it was about letting you see the other side of the coin and that‚Äôs the problem here. I usually love your reviews but this one is a hard disagree with myself. Once you saw Joel die you already made up your mind. This whole story was about inspecting both sides of the coin and you couldn‚Äôt do that. I respect your opinion on this game and those who see the same outlook but for my opinion this game was amazing and I said to myself multiple times ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt end here‚Äù. People can criticize my outlook on this game but overall in my books it was a damn good sequel. 

 When they did kill Joel I was quite devastated but when I learned why he was killed it all made since and it was just a matter of time. Also with Abby‚Äôs sex scene, how can you say that was out of nowhere? Her and Owen were a thing since the beginning, even before she killed Joel you can tell they had that type of history.

 Mel is the best medic they have, which is why she was on the front line, which is why they allowed her to be on the front line. Abby‚Äôs father even said she was the best student he had. Why would you allow some of your best people (I‚Äôm assuming here because Abby massacres any wolfs) without having someone there that can treat any wound she may have. You may sit there and think ‚Äúif she‚Äôs the best why is she out front‚Äù and I would agree with you, if this was based in a time that when people go out and get injured, someone can bring them back to be cared for.

 Tommy doesn‚Äôt seem to care at first because of Maria, have you lived with a women that long to where they alter how you want to act? It‚Äôs an actual thing..and then he acts out near the end because he‚Äôs not with Maria anymore, so he‚Äôs expressing how he truly feels about the whole situation without fear or retaliation. The P.S vita thing, come one. Ellie is not 14 anymore, Joel is dead and she‚Äôs out for revenge. Why would she sit there and want to pick it up? That‚Äôs honestly a not fully thought out remark. We‚Äôre you the same person you were when you were 14 compared to 18+? No probably not and if you say you are then live through the post apocalypse she has.

Now when it comes down to the main characters being saved, I agree with you 110% it made absolutely no sense and there was many time when they could‚Äôve been killed. But in general this is a game so things need to be altered. The comment that you made the best parts of the game were with Joel and Ellie, well yeah. He‚Äôs dead so you cherish his character and when he gets brought up you‚Äôre more uplifted. Ellie is as well, he was her ‚Äúfather‚Äù she can act the way she always has around him without judgment.

 I can agree though, fact when Abby could‚Äôve killed Dina and Ellie said she was pregnant, if I was her I wouldn‚Äôt have cared. It could‚Äôve have been that Lev saying it (the only person she really had left) was the only thing that stopped her and her knowing that Lev seen his sister and mom die just recent could have altered her thoughts. Sitting there saying that she didn‚Äôt do it even though Ellie killed so many unknown wolfs (remember this was at time Abby was known as a traitor so she didn‚Äôt have those feelings towards them anymore).

The ending between them two, I already game my thoughts on this but if you managed to look on both sides, you didn‚Äôt want to see Abby die (not because you were invested in her) but because you knew what she has been through. Also I do agree, before I played the game (just recent) I expected more screen time with Joel because how it was advertised. I think they did that because if they showed him die, well that would ruin sales because who would want to play the game if you know the person you played as in the first game gets killed.

About the whole Abby doesn‚Äôt seem to care about what she did. She didn‚Äôt know Joel besides the fact that he killed her father. Why would she show remorse for the action she did? Ellie not taking the revenge she wanted is because Joel taught her better than that, which is why she had that flashback, Joel was no saint but one thing he did was to teach her right from wrong. Plus he never really showed that side of himself to Ellie.",2021-12-30T03:02:39Z,5,2

1. how did eille and dina didn't suffer any injuries when there horse ran into a landmine that was right below there feet how did dina roll over and took a fall without damaging the baby after the explosion and took  another fall at the school.

2. Why didn't Jordan kill Dina and eille. and dina killed his friend he had a loaded gun but he tried to subdue her given eille enough time to break free and kill him.

3. Why was the people at the WLF stronghold ok with abby and manny taking a pregnant mel to the other base knowing that they were at war with the scars why was abby and manny ok with that.

4. How did yara get to abby and Tommy with one arm and she couldn't climb the ladder if I remember

Fun fact: A Sequels sell numbers always depend on the predecessor.If TLOU 1 would've been a bad game this game wouldn't sold that well.

There are so many messages to absorb from it. But apparently, people who low level of emotional intelligence and no empathy wanted to have another adventure with Joel and Ellie. If a person gets attached to a fictitious character from video games and claim that understand the game but still hate it. There are so features about this person that you can assume:
Immature
Lack of empathy 
Hypocrite
First game Joel killed a lot of innocent people in order to survive and keep Ellie safe. Ellie, A person not related to him that might be the cure for humanity. 
Ellie, didn‚Äôt understand fully joel‚Äôs reasons, punished him by not talking to him for a while. Then Joel dies and she went after revenge because of guilt feeling. 
Abby killed joel because he killed her father
Abby turned against her own group and allies with ‚Äúthe enemy‚Äù. 
Everyone made decisions and these decisions led to consequences. Who are we to judge what is right and wrong? 
If you put yourself in every character‚Äôs place, probably 90% of the people would do the same. 
Stop being immature because of a death of one loved character. Stop saying that Abby is a shit character, she is more similar to Joel and Ellie than you think.

The writing that made the first game so good goes down the drain in the second. Joel's death was obviously gonna happen in the sequel but it could have been done so much better like how they did (Spoiler) Lee's death in telltale's the walking dead. Instead they insult the old fans by killing joel like his nothing and forcing us to be Abby and care for her that really makes no sense for writing. Abby was a character that could have been liked for me if They simply just did this. Abby confronts Joel and says you killed my father and wants to kill him, the infected interupt and the confrontation is left to a later date. When they meet again Abby just once to kill joel but gets captured by the people who raided her camp. Joel decides to save her but then is attacked by the people who killed abby's people. So instead of us wanting to kill Abby we want to kill the people who nearly killed Abby and the ones that killed Joel. This way Ellie and Abby can work together to get revenge. To me that would have been a better story than the garbage we suffered to play three. When I got upto the point where I was playing as Abby and had to fight Ellie, it was the most angriest I've ever been at a videogame and thrown my controller away. Never has a game made me this upset because they made you care about Joel and Ellie so much and making them the villains was the wrong move.",2021-12-14T22:18:31Z,9,9

Is it a goot game? yes, is it a 'game of the year"" good game ? no, oh boy it looks  great though! ( opening horse ride scene ;) ), the story is kinda trash with some strong parts here and there imo , kinda like in a Disney Star Wars way, where it took a huge huge dump on the build up of the TLOU 1,   joel being Luke basically in this case. To put it into perspective what i mean by that, if TLOU 1 did not exist, this games story would be great not excellent but great, its a sequel and its not treated as such character development wise and even in a more ""macro"" point of view it just does not feel natural to me the way it progresses. Their message is clear, Payback is bad, because we say so and we are gonna try in every way possible to make you agree with us, witch makes it feel forced, and for many they failed at that as well. Basically it is a right vs wrong story written by some hot-headed teens that think they're always right. Other than that it was fun to play through but at times, especially at around the mid section i quit the game for some time, reason being you are made to do whatever you already did for 16 hours, for another 12ish? hours gameplaywise , from a prospective of the game that to this day even after all their tryhard to make me care with some stupid manipulation i still don't give a single f about..... and only to get back and rush this part hoping the ending would redeem it, but nope....  Is it wierd if you aske me yes its worth the playthrough would i buy it again ? no, does that make sense ? 
 
EXTRA* Advertising this game like you'll be playing with Joel for a reasonable amount of time was a dick move and should be illegal, i would call it false advertisement. 

So here is my score for the game.

Gameplay : 7 /10
Visual : 10/10
Story : 2 /10

I didn't give 2 shits about the story after what they did to Joel. What a poorly written, woke, trashcan fire of a game this really is.

Did people really think they were just gonna make us play the same game again with Ellie and Joel. If that's the case just play the first game over and over again. Life isn't a fairly tale that goes the way you want it to. Shit happens and the people we love die. Also the fact that some of you were harassing Abby's face model is pathetic and makes no sense.

1. Pandering to political groups of any kind is NEVER good for your game. See Battlefield V for example.

2. I've seen women with muscles. Look at Holly Holm, Ronda Rousey and Gina Carano. Abby is fucking She Hulk with those muscles. It's hard to take her design seriously because of that.

It‚Äôs an overly contrived mess that has flashbacks within flashbacks‚Ä¶within flashbacks and plot lines told in the wrong places because they want to be ‚ÄúNon linear‚Äù about it. Did anyone complain about the first game being ‚Äúlinear‚Äù? Fuck no! Because nobody cares if a story is linear or non linear, all we care about is a good story.

All characters primary Ellie and friends are fucking retards.

The Abby and Ellie fight scene is so stupid. There is a scene where Abby is strangling Eli and her response is the flail her arms and just kind of lightly smack abby on the arms and almost passed out before going ‚ÄúOh right I have a fucking knife in my pocket‚Äù and pulling it out and instead of stabbing her in the side, in the stomach, in the chest, or you know IN THE NECK she goes

‚ÄúNa bro this thy is the best spot it will totally work.‚Äù

Like what the fuck.

Then when Ellie‚Äôs getting her face punched in Dina who is very good at combat from what we‚Äôve seen before and knows how to use a knife decides that screaming and flailing about with the knife is the best option instead of just running up and stabbing. 

Like WHAT THE FUCK naughty Dog. 

How the fuck did you think this was fine. Like how the fuck did no one say ‚Äúthis doesn‚Äôt seem very smart‚Äù and let it in. 

I have seen Skyrim NPC‚Äôs who are smarter than this and they were walking into a fucking wall.



Edit: I highly disagree on the AI 
Being smart

They will be shot and being shot at and choose to slowly walk to you directly and slightly flinch as a pistol round just barely misses their head instead of staying in cover, they will pop out while you are shooting there cover, the will rarely duck back down into cover while they are being shot when they are directly behind it.",2021-11-24T01:36:03Z,5,5

honestly really like your stuff.
maybe this game is just too heady for you.
it was perfect.
if you're uncomfortable because of it. 
then you should probably realize that it's talking about something deeper.
it's about forgiveness.
moving past trauma. 
seems like you haven't experienced much trauma.
if you had, this would have been a very cathartic experience.
I hope you don't have to go through this kind of trauma.
I have.
I wish you could have had more empathy for people like me who has had trauma like this.
no worries.
hope you replay this without bias
I know you probably won't.
just to clarify. when you are traumatized, you make choices that don't make sense.

I really thought that Ellie and Abby were going to kill each other Or Ellie did killed Abby and the kid wake up and saw Abby get kill. Then the kid kill Ellie. But nope they did a sequel 3 bait. She let Abby live and take off. After Ellie went back home and her girl friend and the baby was gone. watch her walk away in the field. So if they did make a 3rd game. Do you want them to meet again but they work together instead of being ememis. Abby and Ellie try to find another way to make Ellie vaccine from her body but at the same time a cult find out that Abby and Ellie went to stop the disease. They try to stop them. Because they worship the diseased people. Just  like Days Gone. There's a group of people who wants to be a Zombie. And new game mechanic that you can switch back and forth  switch between Abby and Ellie with their own style of fighting abilities, weapon and tools

The storyline was weak and it made me dislike Ellie and like Abbie in the end , I get that they made a conflicting, complicated story that makes you go through emotions, but overall it was weak and hardly made me empathetic towards anyone ,   the whole game was based on negativity , ill decisions, vengeance and often the story was dragging with no real purpose. I personally did not like the gameplay either, I thought is is weak as well, too much falling down from places, fight scenes were too long, new features like killing a dog and those stealth zombies was frustrating, L1 barely worked to dodge the attacks , constantly had to figure out how to get out of rooms in a frustrating way and in the end I hardly liked any of the characters, ironically apart from killing Joel - my favorite character was Abbie , Ellie was vengeance driven fool, that is how she was portrayed. Scarrs seemed completely weird characters with no story - why would the praise that woman so fanatically , I was just glad the game was over and I finished playing it and not plan to play it ever again",2021-10-24T19:55:14Z,1,1

I actually didn't have much of a problem with Joel's death or the way he died. Maybe it's because I'm not in the ""The Last Of Us is the greatest game ever"" camp. I thought the game was really good but its not in my top 10 favorite games.

I was actually really excited to see how Ellie would end that bitch for what she did and then....

They  forced me to play Abby and worse, tried to force me to empathize with her. It was one of the oddest narrative choices ever in a game and one that angered me to no end. It made me hate the Last of Us 2. It's a game I will never revist because the story is so ridiculous.

On top of that the game play isn't anything revolutionary. It gets boring fast especially once the story falls apart. The first game also had really basic gameplay but it doesn't matter much because the story is the focus and point so that gameplay never gets in the way of my experience.

In TLOU2 the gameplay is really static and rather boring so once the story completely falls apart the game becomes a chore because the gameplay is unable to help carry you through.

Lastly the fakeout ending only for another two or three hours to get to the real ending only for the payoff to be horrible with Ellie losing fingers and Abby getting to sail away into the sunset. 

TLOU2 is filled with horrible characters, terrible story elements, and convoluted narrative choices that make it one of the worse games I have ever played. The fact that it's a beautiful game matters not because there are legions of great looking games. The fact that critics jerked off to this game with 10/10 reviews but shit all over Days Gone because of how basic the story was is laughable. Days Gone has 1000x the gameplay of TLOU2, and I feel the story is infinitely better with side characters I actually liked and antagonist that while feel like 1980s B-movie bad guys still were interesting and fun.",2021-10-23T20:12:52Z,2,13

The whole journey for nothing, Joels death was for nothing, no real climax, just a sad lonely ending walking off with nothing to show for it, the worst writing I've seen in years still, nothing more then a 3 maybe a 4 with the decent ok soundtrack, but nothing more.

Only Fates masterfully makes the player bitterly hate a character one minute and then sympathize with him the other. I think the key difference between the two games lies in the characterizations and the pacing. Fates tells two* full stories one at a time, and makes sure both parties of the conflict are likeable in their own right. The Last of Us Part II has chaotic pacing that can‚Äôt sit still, with characters who are insultingly heavily telegraphed to the player as being good or evil.",2021-10-23T17:31:36Z,1,26

It was more about a  few days in the lives of these two characters, whose path crosses almost as if it was fate. But to say that all the characterization and dialogue was ass, is just plain BS. I can agree that there‚Äôs a ton of directions they could‚Äôve gone, sure. But for the story they settled on, it was concise and the ending was powerful. It was almost as if Ellie and Abby instinctively knew that they were, essentially , each other. And throw in lev and Dina as foils to their character arcs, it told a provocative and albeit tragic story. The game deserves more praise then hate.

Revenge is not the answer and you get nothing out of it. In fact it just leads to more trouble in the future. When Joel killed Abby‚Äòs father it let her to kill all of Ellie friends and that led her to kill all of Abby‚Äôs friends to, so when she almost killed Abby she realize that that‚Äôs not going to accomplish anything at all. So yeah the theme of this game is forgiveness. People are gonna hate me when I say this but Joel is not a good person at all. He kills people almost no reason and he was selfish. He cared about her daughter more than humanity, which is kind of silly honestly, and to to hear people say they hate Abby for killing a ‚Äúbeloved‚Äù character is not realistic.

All the people who like TLOU2 love to go on and on about how realistic it is and how ""real"" the characters are. They may even argue that the story was well written, structured and grounded. And yet, when we actually use realism on the story and try to analyse it, several things happen:
1. The Cordyceps fungus, as it functions like a plant, would be gone by Winter. But that's assuming we're being realistic.
2. Any infected that are without proper heating will have their body parts come off due to the intense cold and frostbite as well as all the other natural elements.
3. We don't use vaccines to take care of fungi, that's what antibiotics or topical solutions are for. Even if we were to go with game's logic and assume that the vaccine would work somehow, the chances of creating it, in the world and situation that's presented to us, are extremly small, like below 10% if we're charitable and below 5% if we're realistic.
4. Any self-respecting parent wouldn't let their child get angry at them for saving their life from a bunch of thugs who know nothing about medicine. Ellie is essentialy saying ""You ruined my death!"" which is just stupid.
5. Any self-respecting parent would take disciplinary action if their child was acting as much of a little brat as Ellie was and would make sure to set the record straight. Joel had so many ways to explain his actions and he chose none of them.
6. The idea that Joel or Tommy would ""get soft"" after living in Jackson for 5+ years is ridiculous. They're living in a time where, at any moment, they can be set upon by monsters of the human and inhuman variety, so their survival instincts would only get more keen. If you were able to build a community in these arduous times, you'd be more battle-hardened and focused on making sure your community and everyone who lives in it are safe 100% of the time.
7. The idea that Joel or Tommy would be willing to help a random person fight off a zombie horde is ridiculous. Let's not forget that at the beginning of TLOU, Joel demands Tommy not stop on the road to help another family. 
8. Everything Abby does throughout the game makes her unlikable and extremely easy to hate. She brutally tortures a man while his brother lay unconscious nearby and his daughter is forced to watch; she has no qualms about murdering children; she doesn't give a shit that a pregnant woman somehow strong-armed her way onto the frontlines of combat; she takes advantage of and sleeps with an emotionally vulnerable and inebriated man; she murders a father-to-be and takes glee in the thought of murdering a pregnant woman; and she has no sense of loyalty, as she mows down her friends of most likely years for a kid she met literal hours ago. But hey, she loves dogs, is a white woman, and respects the pronouns of Discount Mulan, so that means she's a-okay.
9. If this game actually gave a shit about choice, Abby and her group of friends would have died at the hands of Joel, Tommy or Ellie from the moment they met Joel.
10. Abby, as someone who has murdered a lot of Seraphites, has literally no reason to trust Yara or Lev. She wouldn't give a shit about the internal politics of an enemy faction she's been killing in droves.
11. Pregnant women would be the most protected people in this age, and the idea that Mel is somehow able to go behind Owen's back and go on the frontlines is ridiculous. If this were ""realistic,"" Owen would have fought with Mel and Isaac to make sure Mel doesn't step foot outside of the WLF base.
12. Ellie not thinking for even a second about having children to spread her immunity is ridiculous. The damn brat is so hung up on wanting to die for the most ridiculous reasons that she didn't consider for one second to breed. And the idea of Joel not asking anyone in Jackson about this, or telling Ellie that her being alive would mean more to him and everyone in Jackson is an insult to the audience's intelligence.
13. Finally, in a world of limited resources and food, it makes no sense from a realistic standpoint that Abby is as big as she is. As a woman, it is significantly more difficult for her to gain and maintain muscle mass than it would be for a man. It would take her more than a couple years to get that big.

And that's not even the end of it, we could write a book about how the creation of vaccine would have barely any effect on the world and in fact could cause even more deaths... Unless we're just throwing logic out the window.

Every time I see someone say this game's story is well-written, I have to wonder if they're insulting my intelligence. And then I think that these are the exact kind of people Neil Druckman was trying to appeal to: the people who are literally too stupid (I'm sorry but I can't find a word that would fit better) to think about these kinds of things and lack the critical thinking to realize that there is almost nothing (graphics, animations and voice acting are great, but that's about it) redeemable about this game.",2021-09-29T11:51:30Z,1,12

Have Ellie and Joel start off, where Joel begins to believe Ellie is ready; but, the two get into a close call, and Ellie gets hurt, so Joel reverts back to being overly protective, and starts to forbid Ellie from leaving as much, as he feels responsible. Even when Ellie starts saying she wants to go back out, he is nervous about letting her, and only allows it if he can go with her. So, she has to start sneaking out on her own; only at one point; Joel catches her, and the two get into a heated argument. Which ultimately breaks, with Ellie running off for a while, and Joel trying to find her.

We'd then alternate, playing as Joel (trying to find Ellie, to apologize and get her home safely; while dealing with people who clearly have a beef against him), and Ellie, who could have wandered along, and been doing well, surviving and fighting dangerous threats. She could even meet up with Abby, and she could explain the story of how ""-insert plot spoilers-"" and, have Ellie sympathize with her; and the two sorta develop a relationship, with Ellie looking up to how strong Abby is, and how strong Ellie's optimism and bravery is in the face of all the danger.

The biggest conflict would then erupt; when Joel finds Ellie and Abby; and Ellie is sorta tossed between the 2, because Abby recognizes Joel, as the one she's been searching for; so now it's clear the 2 want to kill each other. She doesn't want them to kill each other, but it's clear they won't just put down the situation. So, you need to pick a side for Ellie to support.

But... it's clear why they didn't do this, when you sit down and analyze it. Because EVERYONE would side with Joel, not Abby, and they REALLY wanted you to side with Abby.",2021-09-15T04:15:38Z,2,7

The game starts with Joel cleaning a guitar, it's not been long since him and Ellie came back to Jackson. Joel is telling Tommy what he did to save Ellie from the fireflies. Tommy is speechless and suggests they head back to Jackson. They ride on horseback through an abandoned suburb and follow a river back to Jackson. As Joel gets his bag from his horse Tommy says he wouldn't of done anything different and promises to keep Joel's secret.

Joel fixes the guitar he was cleaning and sings a song to Ellie as he had promised in the previous game.

It didn't suck.

4 years go by. . . 

Ellie wakes up in bed to a knock on her door. It's 6am and she's late for her rounds. She opens the door to Jesse. Jesse is one of the residents of Jackson who had been assigned to do the clearance rounds with Ellie that day. Ellie answers the door and Jesse makes a joke about Ellie kissing his ex girlfriend last night.
Ellie doesn't bother changing out of her clothes from the night before and doesn't bother brushing her teeth. Even though she had a perfectly functional tooth brush in her toilet.

Ellie and Jesse meet up in a pub and receive bigot sandwiches.

Ellie throws snowballs at kids and is totally swooning for Dina.

They go through local towns clearing infected. They find an old grow house and smoke really dry old weed. They become scissor sisters. Jesse comes in and tells them Tommy and Joel are missing so Ellie runs off in search.

Cut to new character Abby.

Abby won Mrs Apocalypse. She's built like a T100 Terminator. She walks off with Owen, a likable ex firefly friend. Owens found the town. Abby sulks because Owen has got his new gf preggers. Abby by luck of fate, runs into a hoard of infected and miraculously gets saved by the one man she wanted to find in the town. Joel Miller.

Joel saves Abby. Abby introduces Joel and Tommy to her friends and as a welcoming gift she decides to blow Joel's kneecap off with a 12 gauge shotgun. 

She gets Owens new gf to put a belt around the wound. She picks up a 4 iron and decides to cave Joel's face in.

Poor Ellie walks in and witnesses everything.

Joel is dead. Ellie now goes on a revenge mission.

Dina gets pregnant, it's not Ellies so she escapes the child support payments.

Ellie goes around killing Abbys friends. Abby finds Ellie and shoots Tommy in the leg and face.
Abby and Ellie have a fight backstage. 

Abby spares Ellie and pledges to never seeing her again.

2 years pass.

Ellie and Dina have moved to a farm. They both look happy and they've got a cut baby that looks nothing like Ellie. 
A lamb frightens Ellie. She hears Joel's sheep like death scream.

She leaves everything to kill Abby and avenge Joel. 

Finally some justice.

Nope.

Ellie will find Abby in California. She's joint an extreme weightless boot camp.

Ellie finds her tied to a cross so she looks like crackhead Jesus.

Ellie decides to save Abby and Abbys new fake son, Lev.

Unbelievably Ellie changes her mind once again. She wants Abby dead. They fight, they bite and Ellie loses 2 fingers. 

Ellie changes her mind once again and let's Abby live.

Ellie goes home to the farm. Plays guitar badly and remembers Joel's last words to her.


She cries. He cries. We all Cry.

Ellie walks off into the distance alone.

Shes decided she needs a gap year from all this crap. She'll probably grow dreads and armpit hair.

When she comes back she'll be a better person. . . A better person who brushes her teeth before she goes out on patrol. A better person who doesn't go out on a revenge mission for nothing.


Tommy gets free parking because he's now disabled.

It makes me wonder if maybe they could've handled this story by giving us Abby's story as a full game, that could've maybe led into last of us 2, making us care about her as a character, and then maybe presenting the story of last of us 2 differently. Maybe in this version, you never play as Abby, because her story was set up in Abby's game. It would allow for them to set Abby up in a much better light, allowing us to really develop a relationship, so that in the last of us 2, we really feel conflicted playing as Abby as we slowly kill off all of her friends that we met playing as Abby in her game. It would also have allowed them to flesh out the wolves and scars storyline more fully, which would've been great cus the scars were actually interesting and I wanted more about them. It could lead to a similar one on one fight between Abby and Ellie. Instead you play as Ellie in the theater, and you're hunting Abby. Imagine how terrible you'd feel fighting Abby in that theater after all that. Maybe throughout the game they actually show Ellie having remorse as her decision to kill an entire cities worth of people to get to one person tees her apart and it culminates in a similar way to the final fight with Abby. Ellie can't go through with it, she lets go of Abby, breaks into tears right there. Abby sees how broken Ellie is you can see in her face that she feels remorse, pain. She's broken too. she walks away, everyone having lost everything in the name of revenge. The credits roll. Like what a powerful scene that would be",2021-09-01T09:42:28Z,1,8

It has been a year since this game came out and I am done sitting idly by and watching while The Last of Us: Part II gets tarnished and crapped on way more than it deserves. It‚Äôs time to give this fanbase an overdue reality check.

This game is beautiful. Jut as beautiful as the first game. It has incredibly realistic gameplay and the story gives you the same level of emotional impact as the first game does. It wasn‚Äôt the emotional impact you wanted, but it was the one you needed.

The first game taught an inspiring lesson about second chances at love and looking forward instead of behind. This game teaches a brutal message about how loss is handled and how vengeance causes an endless cycle of hatred and death that just gets everyone more and more hurt.

This game does what it was intended to do. It starts out making you enraged and wanting to make Abby pay for taking away the man you loved and cared for, but then it changes course unexpectedly and makes you realize something about Abby. That she‚Äôs human. She‚Äôs not a monster you can just kill and claim to be righteous for. She‚Äôs a human being like Ellie, with good traits, flaws, strengths, weaknesses, and other things about her. You come to understand her. You come to empathize and care about her. And eventually begin to question who‚Äôs side you‚Äôre on by the third act of the game.

You all want to know the cold hard truth? You‚Äôre all butthurt that your favorite character was killed off and taken away from you, and in your grief you‚Äôre nitpicking every single flaw you can find within this game in the hope that you can get Neil to retcon it and rewrite it to make it your story. 

Newsflash: that isn‚Äôt going to happen. Neil doesn‚Äôt care how much you all complain or moan or bitch or threaten his staff. This was the story he wanted to tell, even if it wasn‚Äôt  the one all of you wanted to hear.

Please, friends. Joel is gone. He lived a good life. The first game brought a satisfying conclusion to his story arc. What more did you want? A game full of museum flashbacks? Idk about all of you but that sounds pointless to me. I may be a hypocrite for saying all of this as there was a time that I was among you. But then my best friend opened my eyes and made me realize how incredible this game really was. Neil Druckmann is not a sadist who enjoys causing you all pain, so please let go of that delusion.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-sTlYUeT8o,The Last of Us Part II - Angry Review,2020-07-02T02:32:07Z,@evilsonofgod,"Not saying the game as a whole was trash. Of course graphics and gameplay-wise it's 10 out of 10. Problem is with the story.

It's not about Joel dying, it was HOW he died. I didn't really even care about Ellie not killing Abby in the end or if Ellie was lesbian and played house with Dina and her child with a korean dude or if Abby looks like a bodybuilder.

First, let's put the fact that a lot of employees that were part of the Uncharted series and Last of Us 1 are not with ND anymore. Some even left when LoU2 was still in-development. Would it have an impact on the game's story? I would say yes, Bruce Straley is a very good director and his ideas couldn't be ignored even if Neil was the main man for LoU2. What ifs. Anyway....

Back to the game, that was BOTH Joel and Tommy, aside from being brothers, they have history being together and surviving albeit they parted ways after X years, that doesn't change the fact that together they would be really hard to kill by infected or non-infected. Add the fact that Tommy was a former firefly that actually is still alive (fireflies was hunted and killed by the government in Last of Us 1), so that adds to his ""survival"" skills. Even all of this Tommy ""survival"" skills, he never liked how Joel did things during their time together which is why he parted ways with Joel. What does that entail? Joel's ways are extreme even for Tommy's standards, even during a freaking cordyceps-zombie pandemic. You can argue that being in a ""secure"" settlement for X years made Joel soft, maybe even Tommy. Uhhh no! You don't just get soft like that. The pandemic is still present. They are still trying to survive. They are teaching people to survive and plot routes to scavenge and shit, that means they never got rusty, only a bit older. In the real world (I'm not saying all, just the majority) when asleep, even policeman or soldiers pick-up their gun immediately when they hear a noise. Maybe even most normal people who has guns do that. Heck in real life normal people wouldn't even trust strangers immediately.

Was there any survival skills shown in part 2? NOPE. Would they have helped Abby realistically speaking? Yes. Would they have went with Abby? To an unknown person's ""rendezvous"" point that they just met? Even if they are being chased by hordes and hordes of infected? I would strongly argue NO they wouldn't. Some would say if Abby wasn't there (when they saved Abby) Tommy and Joel would have died by the horde. Maybe, maybe not. With my 2nd paragraph above, I would argue they would survive or either Tommy or Joel might die. And seriously, who uses real names like that during an apocalyptic time where people kill each other for survival and supplies? Convenient right? Another convenient thing is Abby was able to convince all of her friends to come (even a pregnant combat medic) with her even though they had responsibilities in WLF itself and even had tensions with the cult guys. (forgot the name). Just look at the Walking Dead for example, even Rick doesn't immediately trust strangers. He does help even if sometimes he was just ""forced"" to help by his group, but he doesn't trust the people he saved. ""How many walkers have you killed, how many people have you killed, WHY?""

They could have done it better if it was really Joel's fate. Some even say Joel ""had it coming"" because of his past (how he survived) and how he ""denied"" the world of a possible ""cure"". Wow, judging how a person survived during a zombie apocalypse. As for Abby's dad, he tried being a hero. He could have stood aside and he would have lived, he's clearly a doctor/scientist (who's really really really important during an apocalyptic time) so I strongly think Joel wouldn't kill him if he did not block Ellie while holding a scalpel in Joel's face. Joel was being selfish? Well I strongly think they still couldn't make a cure even if they were able to study Ellie's immunity. How would they? Do they have the facility and factory? Do they even have the manpower (like really good scientists, doctors and some other educated person in this type of field)? The means to make it? During a post-apocalyptic world? With threats of being overrun by infected or being invaded by hunters/other non-infected trying to scavenge? Nah. Ellie would have died in vain. So no, personally I don't think Joel ""deserved"" it, nor had to be killed-off specially in that unrealistic way.

I really liked the flashback scenes with Joel and Ellie in part II though specially that museum scene. At least Joel was able to tell Ellie the truth, but Ellie wasn't able to completely ""forgive"" him yet then he got murdered. I mean, they could have just made a game about that and I don't think people would mind. That would have been a good plot, Ellie going back to UT to the hospital to get some answers, Joel going after her then in the end telling her the truth with flashbacks about the museum and the hotel, etc.


Anyway that's it for me.",2021-07-25T15:52:37Z,1,5

TLOU2 is a philosophy not just playing game and kill the characters we do not like!. it is about to put you in a situation to understand how harsh some of our desicions are and how it can affect other people.
sometimes to put yourself in someone's shoes (here Abby) and understand how they feel.
for us it is just pull the trigger and go on. but when we pulled it, it started changeing people's life.
this is why it gets 10 .

Perhaps if he'd spent a bit more time actually playing this as a game, rather than his own fantasy, then he might have a different view. This is Naughty Dog's game - and Joel; Ellie and even Abby are part of that story.  Whether you ended up on team Ellie or Abby (perhaps that was also an intended consequence) the game made you feel things. Uncomfortable thing. It intentionally made you have to see a different perspective, even if it was easier to just see Ellie as some gritty child survivor (and pseudo daughter of Joel). I hope this is the end of Ellie's arc - and people don't understand that Abby / Lev are the Joel / Ellie of this story, then I really don't know what game they were playing. Was that what people wanted - almost certainly not - but was it interesting and thought provoking (like the first game was) - yep. It seems people didn't actually get the first game, and just wanted the same sort of thing. That was never going to happen.

The only thing that I agreed with 100% was the gratuitous sex scene... if this is meant for adults, we know what's going to happen. We don't need to have it rammed down our throat (yes, I'm one of those that thinks that GOT kinda looked ridiculous with the amount of gratuitous sex scenes... because... ratings?). I'm sure the argument is that we are meant to reflect on our reaction to this scene ... against the incredibly brutal killing that we encounter in the game. It's for this reason that I (begrudgingly) think the scene works... but this really deserves it's R rating (in Australia).

I have to say  however - the penny dropped with the Mel references ""Stay your arse at home until you give birth""... that's unfiltered Joe right there. Or perhaps his idea of the apocalypse is that women have a rightful place being incubators. Actually - the more I watch this review, the more I want to unsubscribe.",2021-07-06T09:02:50Z,25,6

The point that you were so emotionally triggered by Joel's death was part of it - and yes, the callous quick way in which it happens. It tells us, this world is bigger even than Ellie and Joel. It also tells us - you (and us) don't own the story of TLOU, we walk part of the way, and often that is in uncomfortable shoes. The truth, Ellie died on that operating table, and the Ellie that now 'lived' in Jackson was a ghost of the real person, cloaked in the guilt and anger of what Joel did - and (this is the clever part) that anger is derived from Joel taking her choice away (like the game). It is intentional that Abby comes across as much more human (despite the inhumanity of Joel's death)... hers a story of revenge too, for having robbed her of the one she loved; Joel's death becomes contextualised by what was taken from her. You may have wanted to play literally TLOU (extended version), but instead Naughty Dog showed that they wanted another story. I think it's a fantastic game, with a heap of truly memorable set-pieces - my only complaint was that the repeat (extended epilogue) was too long, and felt tacked on. I think it's also a little clumsy, as Ellie should have (on entering the Rattlers camp) realised the punishment already given to Abby (coincidentally). Her final threat to kill Lev was the step too far for her to have found redemption; whereas Abby had already found the inner peace of realisation. Was it a fun game - yeh, in parts. Was it harrowing? Definitely. Was there parts that I wish hadn't happened. Sure. Was it a masterpiece. 100%.  And yes, that's even playing Abby (it's through playing Abby that we see how differently life could have been for Ellie if only she'd not fallen fully onto the revenge track. I would have preferred to have seen more consequences for Ellie (and Abby for that matter), as despite the games goal, we're all still shooting faces off, blowing brains out, and overall destroying the world. It's a game, but even though we partake in it, the story should be making us uncomfortable. It's meant to.",2021-07-06T08:11:48Z,0,4

After killing Joel and surviving Ellie's rampage, Abby thinks she's at peace, but she's not. Not until she kills Ellie. So Abby creates 8 robots and sends them across the globe to distract everyone while she kidnaps Joel's brother (who was learning necromancy).
When Ellie returns from the dressing room of MegaDeth, she finds a note. It reads:

""Hey whore, I've got Joel's brother. Come and rescue him if you dare, but not before you defeat my 8 robot masters, Rancid Chef Man, Bean Man, Bubba Man, Yo Momma Man, Obviously Compensating For Something Man, Nasty Toilet Man, Camera Man and Unstable Man! I bet my first robot master will wipe the floor with you before you even know about stealing their weapons to use against the next one, let alone me in my island stronghold. 6 aisles! Thank goodness I've cloned my robots in case something happens to the originals. But I've said enough, if you ignore me, Tommy dies! Ha! Ha! Ha! *cough*""

-Abby

And with that, a P.O.'d Ellie sets off for what she should have done last time...KILL ABBY!

Sounds better than what we got, huh?",2021-06-22T03:26:25Z,0,8

The story of this game is perfectly set up by the ending of the previous one in my opinion, and is the natural continuation considering the inevitable ramifications of Joel's decision to save Ellie at the expense of all of Humanity. There was simply no way such an action would not have had enormous repercussions for society (or what's left of it) at large, and more specifically for the characters. The world presented to us is a world where, without the Fireflies and the hope of an end to the plague, people have lost all sense of purpose. The game does an outstanding job at conveying this to the player, both in the grand scheme of things (in the conflict between the WLF and the Seraphites) and in the micro-details of people's lives, specifically in Ellie's. She knows what Joel did, she cannot forgive him and - most importantly - she cannot forgive *herself* for having had it literally in her to save the world but not having done so. Moreover, she didn't even get the chance to make the choice, as Joel took that away from her. Ellie is thus a broken character for good reason: to know that the very fact that she is alive implies that Humanity is doomed is more than enough to confuse and depress a teenager, and to have her father figure killed before she could resolve their conflict is more than enough to set her in a path of revenge. It's all she has left, and the first half of the game paces itself accordingly: the player is forced to experience events from the narrow point of view of her hatred and desire for revenge, and nothing else, because that's where the character stands. 

This arc, while making sense, would be incomplete if it wasn't for the second part of the game, which contextualizes Ellie's revenge in the grand scheme of things, the hopelessness of her quest being put in perspective by the hopelessness of the world at large. The conflict between the WLF and the Seraphites, fighting for the scraps of civilization, is no different from Ellie's anger: an endless cycle of violence spun out of control, unchecked, pointless. This is superbly conveyed to the player through Abby's perspective and her ultimate rejection of this brutality. Her story mirrors Ellie's story, her main motivation having been to avenge his father, killed by Joel in the first game; but unlike Ellie, she already knows, or at least suspects, that this revenge and violence leads nowhere. Through her meaningful interactions with the other characters (especially Owen, Yara and Lev) she begins to see past the anger; unlike Ellie's, her quest is to help others and break the cycle, to redeem herself and pursue whatever hope remains, no matter how faint. This contrast with Ellie's arc is not meant to make Abby good and Ellie bad, but simply to illustrate the different points of view of two people who are, in fact, at different stages of the same process. In its second half, the game does an exceptional job at recontextualizing all the player's actions through the first half, humanizing both sides with a level of complexity and subtlety that few other games have attempted. 

Then we get to the ending, which I found to be a satisfying one narratively, controversial as it may be. Abby's arc is completed by having her spare Ellie and Dina thanks to Lev, who explicitly asks her to stop and who is, in a way, the impersonation of Abby's newfound sense of morality and purpose. Ellie's arc is completed by having her take her revenge to the extreme, rejecting what could have been a happy life with Dina to chase Abby all the way to Santa Barbara, and choosing, at the very last moment, to end the cycle of violence thanks to Joel, who impersonates Ellie's morality and purpose as much as Lev does for Abby. Joel's last minute flashback appearance stops Ellie from killing a person that has by now suffered enough to pay the full price of what she has done. Ellie, who has now lost her family and can no longer play her guitar after losing two fingers, has also payed the price and can now, meaningfully, begin a path of healing (herself and perhaps all of Humanity?) in what could potentially be the setup for Part III. 

I could go on and on, but if all the above is not good storytelling, I frankly don't know what is. I found TLOU2 to be a superb game and artistic piece, well worthy of being 2020's GOTY. It takes creative risks in ways few other games do, and pushes the medium forward (in my opinion) precisely because it does *not* try to appease its fanbase, but instead focuses on telling a story and conveying a message regardless of what fans might think.

Without a good plot though, it‚Äôs just a game (a combat game) and not an experience. And the plot was lacking big time. 1 dimensional revenge plot with 2 sides of the story (felt repetitive and long) playing out in essentially one setting - wet and dreary Seattle. No real sense of adventure, humanity or HOPE in this game - just a politically correct, insular revenge plot carried out in a brutal and dark fashion. By the end of it you just want the violence and game to do exactly that - END. I have replayed part 1 several times and never tire of it, however part 2 i played once and will likely never play again. Each to their own i guess.

You hate Abby. Then you see her side and it resonates, you understand why she did what she did. You comprehend that this world is ruthless and hopeless and everyone has their reasons to survive and do what they do.
Its baffling how so many people just cant accept the death of Joel and shun the whole game completely disregarding gameplay, overall plot, graphics and presentation.

The writers wanted to create a story that would be discussed for the upcoming years. They achieved their goal, thats for sure. After almost a year since the game was released people still discuss about it. The game was a roller coaster of feelings. Happiness, shock, sadness, emotion, anger, hope, comprehension and forgiveness( maybe not from every player), all are there. Technically the game is outstanding for sure and the   music  is amazing and very suitable for the atmosphere of the game. The music adds very much to the general  feeling that the game leaves to the player. My only problem is that so many things in the story do not make any sense in a game  that tries to give  realistic humans and human behaviors during a zombie apocalypse. In the real world we all know Joel would have never fallen in a trap like that. This is a really big foul in the story that the majority of the players can not just let it pass. Joel from the first game was not trusting even his shadow. He was a survivor for 20+ years. Just because in the second game he was living in a society for 5 years( where by the way he continued to hunt infected ) it does not mean he suddenly lost all his survival instincts. It is like when Lebron James stops his career and after 5 years he can not even score a simple lay up. In the real world that would have never happened. As many things in the game and many decisions of Ellie and  especially Abby would have never happened in the real world. Many key events in the story could have happened in a much more realistic and convincing way because it is supossed to be a serious game with realistic characters. But despite the big fouls of the story the game is very unique and it will be discussed for many years to come.  In that domain, the creators absolutely achieved to create an absolutely unforgettable( with its goods and its bads) experience. And for that only they deserve to be praised.",2021-06-12T14:21:44Z,3,3

I believe that many fans are unreasonably salty about Joel‚Äôs death. As the game progresses, the feeling of revenge begins to rot and die. By the end of the game, Ellie‚Äôs revenge plot is dead. I played the entire series and saw the leaks and was salty for a bit. People were so quick to forgive Joel for the awful things he‚Äôs done for his own game. This was the biggest problem for most reviewers who were dead set on hating on Abby. They are so distracted by hating Abby that they ignore the message of the story. Joe spends the entire game hating on the story and not giving a shit about anything else. I makes me laugh that they are so mad at Abby killing Joel when Ellie does some of the most sadistic shit. Also when we‚Äôre there assault rifles that you could pick up? Jacksepticeye made some very good points about the game. Go watch his play through",2021-06-03T18:25:25Z,18,5

They might play similar but Last of Us 1 is unplayable in comparison to part 2.  Everything from the variety of the level design/progress, gun fights, mobility, stealth are all VASTLY improved.

How was the story progressed? Both Ellie and Abby are going to have to kill again, and one day they might kill the wrong person and start a new cycle of revenge. That's just the kind of universe TLoU is. So what was the story even about? Nothing happened. Nothing changed. Abby effectively got her revenge, so it's not as if she really paid for her actions. Her friends died, sure, but they actively participated in Joel's murder, so what difference does it make?

For every flaw you can mention there are just as many good things about the game 

The acting, themes, graphics, characters, arcs, animations, music, sound design, and plenty more are all great in my opinion 

It took me about three play throughs to truly form a good opinion on tlou 2 and I must say 
In my opinion it‚Äôs nd‚Äôs best game by a pretty far margin 

They got so much hate for trying to do something grand and I really hope that doesn‚Äôt make developers shun away from doing something out of the norm for the sake of dividing a fan base 

To be great you have to take risks 

I know it‚Äôs completely different but as a big fan of rap music it‚Äôs like if Kendrick Lamar said fuck it and starting making music to Appel to the mainstream 
Kendrick would be himself if he didn‚Äôt always try to out do himself
He would be drake 

I‚Äôd rather have a game that has some flaws but does something different then a game that that just follows today‚Äôs trends 

For example ghost of Tsushima was a great game but it‚Äôs another formulaic game that conforms to today‚Äôs trends 

The most unique thing got did was it‚Äôs stance system but even this is watered down 

You have for stances to fight the four different enemy types. Would‚Äôve been better to have the four different stance just change attacks and let you form your own combos and play styles then to just force you to use X stance vs X enemy 

I got off topic but in the end my point is games need to stop following these played out gaming trends, with very little to separate it from other games and instead actually try something unique for once, whether that be through story, gameplay, world exploration or whatever

Still I must appreciate joe for criticizing the game so hard 

Hopefully the devs will listen and make the next game appealing to both the fans of the second as well as the people who hated part 2",2021-05-23T22:56:33Z,4,3

I at least partially know why it is good for those who like the game (Opening doors for different types of characters, being able to play as the villain/anti-hero, or just the overall story concept (which I also found interesting), etc), but at the same time I am one of those who doesn't like it for various reasons in my view (lack of connection with events and characters, the order of the outline of the plot, unfulfilled character development, etc). That is just how it is for me, but I find no reason to chastise others for liking and supporting it. There will always be an audience even if you are not a part of it so I think the game should have the right to exist for them, but they should not chastise those that dislike it as well, especially those that respect your perspective of the game.",2021-05-09T19:51:51Z,0,1

You can't make someone likable by having her kill a original character and then try to redeem her by just showing how tough she had it or how nice she is. She needs to have a good reason for doing it. Especially because she is in part 2. Hell even the original cast would need a solid reason for killing anyone especially if they are fleshed out in a sequel. For a new character that goes double. Otherwise she is just the bad guy or girl in this case. Hell with her body and that sex scene even i wasn't sure. Anyway that never happens. Instead they waste to much time making her to be liked so you have a consience problem in the end when you finally fight the bitch..i mean Abby..yeah. Manipulative..yeah i would bloody say so but still just a waste of time because it is obvious where it all goes regardless of all their efforts. She has to die and you have to feel bad about it.

The WLF have better weaponry, more resources, etc, and their entire days are spent trying to kill Seraphites and to take over their land. So in theory, I found this to be intriguing and an important story to tell.

The execution of it, however, just didn‚Äôt come off right, especially since we barely learn a damn thing about the Seraphites other than the fact that they whistle, are ‚Äúa cult,‚Äù and worship some lady. The WLF get way better treatment throughout the game than the Seraphites ‚Äî even though Abby f**king kills Joel!

I still think Neil is one of the greatest storytellers of our time, that TLOU is the greatest game of all time, and I have high hopes for the HBO show. Just please. Neil: don‚Äôt kill Joel.

We have a huge and contradictory list of too much plot armor, but not enough for Joel, resentful that abby gets the spotlight even though you state you actually like her and have no issue with her? Complaining the game is too similar to the previous game even though it's only been 2 games so changing it up s much wouldn't make sense. Revenge is good for Abby but not for Ellie. Even though get equally fucked over by the end. Like I'm guessing the slavers needed to rape her to truly get equal huh. If the objective doesn't get completed by the end the journey is pointless even though that happens in the last game too which you gave a 10 to. The story was left in a worst place off than before how dare they have the story has consequence not bounce back to an easy comfortable status quo. Empire and infinity war are bad because the heroes failed by the end what a betrayal ending the story off in a worse place. Apparently, there are celebrities in the post-apocalypse so everyone should use fake names, or else they're idiots. Joel should kill everyone he comes across now he needs to be a mary sue so we can accuse him of being that too. Apparently, helping settlers in your area is idiotic now? Like for supposed ""film"" and ""game"" critics, you don't seem to know how post-apocalypses work. If you run a settlement and you kill everyone who comes close you'll run out of people to trade with and will starve to death. Joel says it ""those people that came through last week, I'm a little embarrassed of what I had to trade"". People come through all the time.

If they had really wanted us to care about Abby and her friends, they would've set it up better. Make it so Ellie goes out on her own after learning about what Joel did at the end of TLoU and have her meet Abby and her group while they're looking for Joel. Have it so they all travel together and allow us to get to know them more. Then at the end of the second game, have it so they go back to Jackson and Abby and them find out the truth. Abby tries to kill Ellie, Joel protects her and ends up getting killed in the process. 
And then have the third game be the revenge tale and have it so we're constantly switching perspectives between Ellie and Abby's groups. Maybe add some character choice in so it gives players agency in the ending. If they grew to care about Abby, give them the option to not go through with Ellie's revenge. If they still wanted to carry out the revenge, they had the option to. 
Naughty Dog is better than this. As a massive fan of TLoU, this was a mega letdown. Were there some good parts? Yeah, I did like some things in the game, mostly being able to crawl under vehicles and the amount of customization there was in the settings, the graphics were beautiful as well. And I was hype for it, especially after the gameplay trailers we saw of Abby (when we thought she was Ellie's mom) and the fight in the store with Ellie. It looked brutal, visceral, and like a step-up from the original's gameplay (I was a massive fan of the minimalist HUD that was shown during the Ellie gameplay).

I don‚Äôt want to completely sht on it because I see what the writers were going for and I respect it. But a lot of areas felt so cheap in the game. Tlou1 had a simple plot, it was essentially a glorified escort mission. But what made that game a masterpiece is the characters and their development, even though it was much more predictable and simple story. In tlou2 they take advantage of your love for the characters shown in tlou1 that they think they can completely change their personalities and everyone will be fine. The only time most got teary eyed was at the end because they used a cheap ‚ÄúJoel cry‚Äù knowing how much we loved Joel and have only seen him cry one other time ever so it makes you emotional, it wasn‚Äôt earned though. They also made Tommy seem super selfish. In the beginning he wanted to lock up Ellie and keep her safe but near the end he gets mad at her for not going after Abby (I understand he‚Äôs mad at himself because he can‚Äôt go but that‚Äôs not Tommy‚Äôs character even if he was mad he would keep her safe no matter what). The side characters aren‚Äôt that interesting and the flashbacks feel like taunts that you can‚Äôt play with Joel. I never felt exited or interested to hear what Dina has to say but when I was with Joel it truly opened my eyes to how important his dynamic with Ellie is in the game. I also don‚Äôt like how they handled deaths, In the tlou1 a hard hitting scene for me was the death of Sam and Henry. But in tlou2 they die and you get no time at all to even take it in. Joel had a grave moment and after that he wasn‚Äôt acknowledged, even Jessie just died and nothing. They also butchered the characters we love in order to try and make us like other characters (Abby, Owen, etc.) Ellie is left alive twice by Abby even though she killed all her friends but Ellie is so stubborn and mad that she can‚Äôt let it go showing how the writers want you to like Abby but affecting Ellie‚Äôs character as well. There are also so many inconsistencies and plot armor in the story, for example Ellie kills many people but when she kills an important side character she has these thoughts of regret. In tlou1 Ellie didn‚Äôt kill humans, it was after that one scene with Joel almost being drowned that they established how it isn‚Äôt easy for her to kill but she will do it to survive. She never just started killing people without addressing it in some way. 

All in all the I give the story a 7-10 and everything else (gameplay, graphics, voice acting, music, environment, etc) 9-10 some of the most fun I‚Äôve had with the gameplay and fights but the story didn‚Äôt quite do it. I hope the writers (Druckmann and Gross) learn from this and don‚Äôt just ignore it hurting more of naughty dogs legendary franchises.",2021-04-23T23:41:35Z,1,5

I find it kind of cringe there too, but all in all it's not out of form. 

In argument to how people received the game poorly;
I believe that if they sold the game as ""A new group in the same world"", then you live as them, get to connect with them, and suddenly you hear about an attack on the base, and your father is murdered, and suddenly it dawns on you. That for these people, Joel is the villain. 

In a trolley problem, everyone would say that the life of one for a cure for all of humanity would be the morally just thing to do. In the end of the first game, Ellie makes it painfully clear that she would have wanted to die if it meant it would save humanity. It was expected that Joel's lie built a wall between them. It was natural for this to fester.

I think players really felt let down, by having to feel the gravitas of Joel's actions as a tension between them, culminating in his death with so many things left unsaid nor solved. However, that feeling I think comes from a natural empathy the audience has for Ellie, how we would feel if we lost someone before resolving our issues. Is this bad game design, or is it just that we care so much about the characters who die that we mourn while playing? 

I do understand the leudonarrative dissonance, wherein Ellie kills so many who have done nothing to her, only to spare the one whomst has harmed her the most. For me it's the game's most valid criticism. In the first game I had a similar moment, the fact that you couldn't spare the surgeon by shooting him in the hand still rings weird to me, even though it at the same time ended up being the most powerful moment of it. Just like the first games climax, the second game also removes your agency, but instead of killing like Joel, Ellie at a similarly deciding moment, chooses mercy.

16:42 - It's kind of funny, because if you played the second game first, you might say the same about Joel and Ellie's relationship as it's being built. 

Seemingly TLOU's biggest mistake, is that their characters were too likable.",2021-04-18T17:47:02Z,0,0

Abby is hunting someone but we aren't told who.

As she's searching we find out she's looking for a man used to be a smuggler 

Futher down the road she's looking for him to get revenge for killing someone

Than it's revealed that the man killed her father and that person was Joel. 

That would give players enough time to see things through her perspective and why she hates Joel. Abby kills Joel and the perspect changes from players controlling Abby to control ellie who is now chasing Abby to get revenge. 

Along the way she's remembered the trip with Joel, meeting some people and maybe even Tommy walking her back form the edge saying things like Joel wouldn't have wanted that.

Ellie Beata the shit out of Abby and as ellie about to kill Abby, she leaves as she already does.


Let's make no mistake that what Joel did, even though I understand it, did have consequences.  They just handled abbys development poorly.",2021-04-07T19:07:20Z,0,2

Then, at the middle of the game, Abby finds out that Joel killed her father and the other people at the hospital, causing a civil war between her people and the people from Jackson.

THEN Joel dies, to save Ellie and acepting his fate.

With this, we would be able to simpatize with Abby and the rest, AND THEN we would care about what happens.

Then the other half of the game would be the Revenge Plot, with the option to kill Abby or left her alive.

Or much better:  ""when Abby takes the last from us"" or my favorite   ""nobody cares the last of all bits about Abby"" 

But all these titles are nothing against: 

"" Abby - she's the last of us two""  

Please take a close look at my brutal game of second meanings!  You can read that title from so many perspectives... 
To build up things even deeper, there has to be a second title like

For example in AoT, the reason why Gabi doing... you-know-what didn‚Äôt receive as much flak is because we were able to completely understand her motivations. She sees Paradis invading her home, killing her closest friends and countless others. Because we‚Äôre shown her perspective first, we‚Äôre able to completely understand her actions. I think Gabi and Abby share huge similarities, but the story executed Abby‚Äôs actions in a flawed. Instead of being forced to play as Abby after we see her torture our favorite character and mortally wound two of our friends, we should‚Äôve instead played as her in the first half of the game, before she kills Joel. 

We should‚Äôve been playing as her through her journey to Jackson in her quest to kill Joel, seen her relationship with her father through flashbacks so we could properly understand what was taken from her, seen her relationships with her friends so that we can better sympathize with THEIR motivations for killing Joel (which is that he prevented any hope for a cure.). Then, through her journey, she should‚Äôve seen all the good things Joel did, to the point where she struggles at least a bit with her chosen actions, but ultimately does them anyway.

THEN, when we would‚Äôve gotten to Jackson, we should‚Äôve started playing as Ellie, all the while seeing the actions Abby takes and then seeing Joel‚Äôs death whilst playing as Ellie. Then, we play as Ellie through the rest of the game, killing off the characters we sympathized and understood, until Ellie‚Äôs fight with Abby.

This provides a new perspective for the player. In the game, it is almost physically impossible for us to sympathize with Abby and her friends, because to us, they were just a bunch of characters that showed up out of nowhere and tortured and killed our favorite character after he saved Abby‚Äôs life. It doesn‚Äôt matter what tragedy they went through that they try to show us. Trying to show their motivations and trying to get us to sympathize with them AFTER they did that just doesn‚Äôt work, because our hatred for them greatly overshadows any sympathy we might feel.

If we‚Äôd been shown their motivations and been led to sympathize with their perspective BEFORE they did what they did, then we wouldn‚Äôt have felt anger at them for what they did to Joel. We would‚Äôve just felt sad and angry that it happened. And that would‚Äôve made a huge difference.

The writing in this game was actually amazing, however, it‚Äôs execution was a complete mistake. It completely ruined our love for the franchise.",2021-03-11T09:48:36Z,4,4

You see, the first game had a simple core gameplay loop that felt tight and was well balanced. You wouldn't scavange for too long, difficulty was good, etc.

This one, at least on normal difficulty, just makes you scavange for two thirds of the game only to be out of ammo for most of the time anyway because you can't pick up other people's ammo unless the game thinks it's appropriate. It also likes to spawn enemies out of the blue and have them all flank you in a matter of seconds, especially when you're on your own. At least in the first game, you rarely played alone, you always had someone else alongside you. In this one, the game has no problem overwhelming you with enemies making the game a complete exercise in trial and error.

There's no flow to the gameplay because no matter how well prepared you are, you *are* gonna die in the next encounter because those simply weren't made to be beaten on first attempt.

So yeah, the gameplay is actually worse on this one.",2021-02-26T13:03:37Z,3,2

And god this one needed to be taken back to the storyboard. You guys said it yourself, you can't go back and play it. I've played through the first game nearly a dozen times. I cannot ever play the second because of how negative, depressing, hollow, and just downright stupid some of the decisions were in the story alone...

Imagine having the OPTION to kill Abby at the end, experience the hollow victory of revenge and having her return to home only stop at the gate and turn around leave instead VS CHOOSING to spare her and return home knowing that you the PLAYER has given upon revenge then Ellie return home to your child and wife having finally accepted what had happened... 

Not only is this a better way to end a story, it opens the bloody door for multiple playthroughs.

There, I made a better ending, now give me the keys to naughtydog so I can put this show back on track. There are so many other writers on YouTube that have provided may more compelling and epic ways to tell this story.

This game feels more like a shitty motel one night stand with any sleep that just drags on while desperately try to just get the ending so you can be done VS an epic thriller which lets the journey be the adventure that you crave never ends.

Ones a compelling story that wants to be told again and again, and the other is a gaslight induced overly dramatic and under performing nightmare.

For the time being, the Last of Us is still a great story alone. And that is how it will remain in history while the second is slowly forgotten. 

Also Abby's father is a F***ing idiot and deserved to die for wanting to kill a child without EVER f***ing asking the child. He's also a medical moron for attempting to do brain surgery when only having trained as a cardiologist. And for having killed OTHER PATIENTS while attempting THE SAME SURGERY. That is the literal definition of insanity. Doing the same thing over and over again but expecting a different result.

You cannot stand on a soapbox and show your work and call it a masterpiece if your a not willing to take the criticism that comes with it. Niel Druckman is a child and needs to admit that he's made mistakes. Otherwise he will continue to live like a blind duck with one leg; swimming in an endless circle until he takes the blindfold off or asks for help.",2021-02-20T07:07:27Z,1,6

TLOU2 is actually a quite good standalone title, it just completely fails as a sequel of the first one. 6/10 is kinda harsh, I would give it a 7+/10 just for graphics, physics, AI, and gameplay. Too bad the story and characters that were the most important thing in TLOU1 are the biggest flaws here. Still a massive letdown, just like Cyberpunk with other issues. Druckmann defends the game saying that people dislike it because of Joel's death that is controversial. Well, even aside from that, the writing, description of characters is simply a league behind TLOU1. I can't believe it gained more GOTY awards than Witcher 3 which is a much superior game. Probably because there was no great competition either. 2020 was a year of broken promises.",2021-02-16T09:39:16Z,1,1

It feels more like a violent murder spree action game than a complex story about human nature and your own kind of hope in the apocalypse. Hope? A brighter side in the apocalypse? Fuck all that! Trust is terrible, people always lie, revenge is a worthy enough cause to leave your devoted girlfriend behind, hypocrites prosper, all who oppose your ideals are inhuman, and life is just fucking awful every day! 

There's tragedy and then there's over-bloated melodrama. Last of Us is a timeless classic not because it was depressing or some action packed romp to save the world or fight for ideals. It was about survival and finding the things worth living for in a time when many have given up on life. It's the ultimate story about finding light, however meager it may be, in the darkness of a ruined world.

The first game is easily one of my favourite games ever, and I was really looking forward to Part 2. I felt the massive kick to the nuts that all the other fans of the first game felt when playing it. So disappointing the route they took with the story and character progression.

I've noticed that a lot of people in comment sections of Part 2 reviews that defend the game admit they've never even played the first game lol, explains a lot. If you never played and fell in love with the first game then it's going to be hard to feel the crushing disappointment the second game brought to the die-hard fans of the first.  

Over the 7 years between the first and second game, there was so many theories about how it would play out, so much optimism and excitement for its release - then the day finally arrived, and after all that waiting and wondering, after all the time spent replaying the first game and stewing in the ever building anticipation of another amazing Ellie and Joel adventure... we ended up with a terrible story and had to endure the horrible experience of watching everything we loved about the first story get torn to shreds. Like you said at the end of this video, they took a huge gamble and it didn't pay off.

Such a shame. If they do number three, god knows where that one is going to go, but after seeing our beloved characters from the first game get completely ripped apart in Part 2, I don't think I'll bother with it. Only way I would is if it ends up being a prequel showing the back story of Joel and Tommy after Sarah died or something, otherwise r.i.p The Last of Us.",2021-02-10T03:17:41Z,0,1

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-sTlYUeT8o,The Last of Us Part II - Angry Review,2020-07-02T02:32:07Z,@Argomentatore,"I liked the game... 
But I still have a major problem with it: THE CHARACTERS.
Diva, Jessie and all Abby's friends are... Flat, uninteresting, useless. Simply poorly written.

Noone questioned Ellie's decisions during the 3 days. Jessie should had at least confronted her about the necessity of bringing back Dina since she was pregnant. And Dina has no purpose, no motivation, no opinion. She always agrees with Ellie and so she has no role in the story untill the very last moment when finally she disagrees with Ellie's decision to leave her and JJ to pursuit her vengeance. 

The best moments of the first game were the conflicts, because in conflicts you can clearly see the motivation behind each character and better understand who they are. Tess, Henry, Sam, Bill, David, Tommy and Marlene, we all learned who they were through the disputes they had with the two main characters. They are memorable because they had purpose. They crossed the path of the protagonist in a meaningful way, leaving their mark and changing the story. 
I clearly remember the cutscenes of the fight between Joel and Tommy, Joel and Ellie, Joel and Marlene... In each one we discover a little more about Joel's world view only thanks to the collision with opposing world views from the other characters.

In The Last Of Us part Two, we get nothing of that. Not one scene where we see two people arguing in a meaningful way. The best thing we get is the fight between Tommy and Ellie at the end of the game. But we needed more of that, so much more.

Why won't they use Jessie more to question Ellie actions? He just gives her the look that one time saying ""ok, good luck"". What is that??? 
Why did they gave Dina a voice only at the end of the game?
And above all, at the end of the 3 days, why did they decide to go home without even discussing about it. 
Jessie and Dina had a baby to protect, Tommy and Ellie wanted revenge. 
""Do we leave or do we stay?"" ""Do we stop the violence to protect what we have or do we continue our pursuit of vengeance?"". 
I really thought we would see two sides in this difficult decision. But we get nothing. ""Let's go home and I'll give my wife a neckless"".
Come on. 

And on the other hand we did not get anything even from Abby's friends. I can't describe any of them. I barely remember their names. You can eliminate all of them and the story won't notice any difference.
I have no idea what Owen wants or believes... Is he supposed to be a complex character? I remember him just as the guy who cheats on his pregnant girlfriend with Abby in that horrendous sex scene. 
They tell us he killed a wolf to save a scar.... And that the scar was... old? ok.. but he never acts about it afterwards. He didn't try to stop the war or to save the scars. He is just tired of killing between stupid groups, and I get that.. but we already have it with Abby, we understand that world view with her journey. 
In this story Owen doesn't have a distinct role. He could have been a character like the protagonist in Avatar, that switches sides and fights his old friends.  He could have been such an interesting character, what a waste...
All I know about Manny is that he says ""pendejo"" and likes girls. Wow, so interesting.
And we get Mell that is a dumbass who puts her baby at risk for no reason... And someone please tell me why would they make her climb on things wtf?? Why.
It could have been a rescue mission where Abby needed to save her ""enemy in love"" and guide her through the city without her climbing staff because... You know... SHE IS PREGNANT.
But no, she can jump and climb walls, ok.

I don't understand what heppened honestly. I know Noughty Dog can make good characters, Lev is an example.
I love his character arc, I love his relationship with Abby.. 
But one character is not enough.",2021-02-08T09:14:03Z,2,7

If you take the 1st game into consideration then It doesn't feel rushed. And if you say that it doesn't make any sense, that's just factually incorrect. He had it coming since the first game. And if you didn't think that Joel was gonna die in this game then what did you think it was about? 1 more thing: it's completely okay to not like Abby. I get why a lot of people dont like her.

I really do feel bad for those who didn't enjoy the game that Neil envisioned.... I truly do mean that from a place of being... REALLY sorry. Because I am positive that Angry Joe, and anyone else who is reading this comment and didn't enjoy the game, is someone who truly loves The Last of Us, and the entire reason that you're upset with the game, is because you didn't like the decisions they chose, and its upsetting because the last of us means a lot to you. I understand, because The Last of Us means a lot to me. 

The reason I'm saying this is because even now, I'm still replaying encounters and whatnot of this game. It is so visceral, and incredible, and the reason that I say that I'm ""lucky"" is because I truly DID love the game the first time around. I didn't have to ""grow"" to like it, or worse yet, never like it. And for that, I am eternally grateful because my god, we have all waited a long time for this to happen. For those of you out there who still do not like the game.... I mean this with absolutely zero sarcasm or malice... I hope that you can replay it, and maybe see things in a different light, so that you can also experience the feels that this game does offer, just like the first one. 

...some of you may not be ready for what im about to say, but I would say that this one offers even more feels than the first one. By a lot. It's much better than the first one, even. And this is coming from someone who has regarded the first entry of The Last of Us as my favorite game of all time. I still hold that sentiment, except now instad of saying my favorite game is ""The Last of Us Part II"", I just see all of it as .. one entity. The Last of Us. 

And yes, Abby IS cool as fuck. When those of you who are mad replay the game, when you start to calm the fuck down and realize what this game is doing... you realize that Abby is actually even cooler than Ellie in ways, lol. And then of course the amazing moment when you see Lev wearing the same kind of sneakers as 14 year old Ellie, and then Abby, and as they walk down the Santa Barbara neighborhood road, you realize that Abby unknowingly has become Joel Miller, and Lev as Ellie, even more unknowingly as Lev never even met Ellie. Formerly, at least. As Abby said to Lev ""YOU are my people""  ... its clear that over time, Abby became willing to put it all on the line for Lev, not just because she began to care for him and his safety, but for a MUCH deeper reason. The wolf and the scars... wolf and seraphite. Even deeper than that, Ellie was something that brought peace to Joel in some ways after the loss of his daughter, he found a situation laid before him that sort of... NATURALLY offered a supplement in place of that, without him having to force it. And with Abby, losing her father, her joining the wolves and becoming Issacs top scar killer, in some ways became ABBY'S purgatory, if you will. Same as how Joels was a pointless life in the safe zone, smuggling things in and out, sometimes just for fucking ration cards, but through Ellie, finds a way to live a life worth living to him. And with Abby, Lev becomes a way for her to realize that the wolves and the scars are keeping her from moving on from her father. Killing Joel did not bring her peace like she thought it would, and shes trying her best to move on from it now that shes done the thing she went to Jackson to do... its not until finding purpose in Lev, someone whos supposed to be her mortal enemy, that she is able to.

This game, is just as perfect as the first. I will not compare the two. They are one story, and I truly hope that those of you still angry about it, learns that Joel is even MORE of a fucking legend in his death. A martyr. Them disrespecting him in the way he was dead was the entire fucking point. Get a grip please and start to be rational. Because I promise... there is a REALLY powerful story underneath all that anger. I promise you.",2021-02-05T11:14:02Z,2,1

The game isn't trying to get you to like Abby and hate Ellie, or vice-versa, it's trying to get you to realize that they are identically motivated characters from opposing circumstances who both have to be pushed to the brink and lose everything in their own way in order to realize that they don't have to be that person anymore.  Ellie loses Joel, Dina, the baby, and Jesse plus two of her fingers and consequentially the ability to play the guitar (the one great thing that links her to Joel); Abby loses all of her friends, save Lev, she gets tortured for months, crucified, ostracized from the group that's been her only home since the day Joel came in, and all she gets to have is her life and Lev's. It's not so much ""revenge bad"" as it is ""even in this world of absolute shit, you don't have to be the shit you detest, despite that being the complete sum of everything you've ever been taught your entire life"". By the time Ellie meets Abby again at the very end, Abby isn't even really the same person who killed Joel anymore. If this Abby was given the same choice again, knowing everything that would happen alongside it, there's no way she would have still killed Joel. Ellie, on the other hand, finds her true redemption by making her own, independent, choice for maybe the very first time in her life by not killing Abby, realizing that this whole thing stopped being about Joel, or justice, or even true vengeance like 50 bodies back; and that killing her after all this, won't make her feel any less fractured than she already is at this point.  That's what I got from the game, what do you guys think?",2021-02-04T21:21:49Z,2,1

Dina could get popped the next game and I wouldn't really care. But Ellie was still memorable. I was so unbelievably invested in her story, and I even thought making the player play as Abby for a while was an interesting way to make an antagonist seem more human.

‚Ä¢ The writing in of just dumb shit for no reason (Pot smoking scene in Jesse's hideout? Why?) (Seraphite camp that's 20 ft. from Infected territory. For fuck knows why?) (Characters are preset to execute certain enemies only if you kill enemy #2 first.)

‚Ä¢ Why the fuck do they not carry tins, specifically like those giant Albacore or Sardine cans to store ammo in. Can't tell you, LITERALLY CANNOT TELL YOU how man times this fucking game told me my ammo was full and I had like 6-12 shots. The bitch has a backpack that can easily store 200 bullets in it. If the world is so bad, you'll make room sweetheart. I know what size those ammunition rounds are. No way you can only hold 6 extra bitch. But nah man. It's full. 

‚Ä¢ The whole Seraphites ambush as soon as they leave camp in Abby's story... I was like the fuck? How do they even allow them to get into that proximity to the camp on horses and shit? Not even to mention that we kill the same Seraphites chick that's in front of Abby in line to get food in the fucking carport area before the water segment. Either they reused character models (Most likely) or she defected.

‚Ä¢ Then you get Abby. Okay, cool. Love the story shit, but then you get buttfucked by the Devs. Hey, all those upgrades you did and all the shit you stocked up on in the game as Ellie? Yeah, fuck you. Start from 0.

‚Ä¢ Broken Terrain. I've been playing for about 8 hours. Why the fuck have I already ran into 2 bugs. One left me looking through a bus in the underground area towards the beginning of the game and the camera fucked off and all I saw was a grey void and the other consisted of me falling through the map to my death when I went to melee an enemy against the wall in the neighborhood part right after you get the bow? I get 100 hours or some shit, it's bound to happen eventually. Bugs happen. But 8 hours???

It's good story wise but Soooooo fucking bad as a game. Naughty Dog should have just made a movie.",2021-01-26T10:41:08Z,0,3

GoW has walking fortresses of meat, despite the world being ruined, and resources undoubtedly being scarce. Borderlands is full of Brick, and bandits that are bigger that houses.

The problem is that nobody questions it when it's a male character. And Abby has no more meat on her than any man in TLoU pt. 2.",2021-01-26T10:39:11Z,11,1

1) Abby never got to kill dogs even in the end when she had to save Lev from the island which was attacked by the WLF. Why was that since WLF have dogs all the time when hunting for Ellie. Maybe they did not want to take dogs to a war zone? Not sure but it felt like ND trying to feed us to Loveeeeee Abby.

2) The writing is not lazy and yes it's bold but falls flat on it's face when the characters don't act believable. Joel was really Careful in the first game...but maybe due to his age he's gotten soft?

3) No one tells Ellie the reason for Abby killing Joel...or are we supposed to know that Ellie knows the reason but not confronted in the game?

4) Abby only in the end figures out that someone is trying to kill the ex fireflies group in WLF...I mean I wish the 3rd day was atleast Abby figuring out that Abby is being hunted and is trying to find ways to get to Ellie...but in fact it's just one cut scene in the very end when she finds the map.

5) Lev became a favorite character of mine ... I expected more from Dina during Ellie's gameplay.

6) I understand why Owen did not want to kill Ellie and Tommy cause he was already in turmoil with killing people and the loss of Danny and the old guy from the scars who was ready for death caused him to reach his breakpoint.. however Who the F is Danny?

7) I was just really excited the whole time before the game was out thinking how bezerk would Ellie go when she figures out the Joel lied to her about what happened with the fireflies in the first game...but it was reduced to a cut scene and she already knew it while playing her from the beginning. Not sure how they could have executed it better but that was the hook of the first games ending and to use it this way felt quite meh.

I feel if the first game did not exist...this game would have been well received... however they killed the continuation of the characters from the first game. Playing as Abby when we already hate her was really difficult... however it was interesting to see her point of view...was there another medium of entertainment that provided the backstory of the protagonist and the antagonist backstory as equally as this game? Would like to explore and see how did that play out. 
If the first game existed without a story and it was pure gameplay it would have been a 6 or 7 out of 10...it was the story that made it 10 out or 10. Even though the gameplay was quite similar with a lot more detail this time..the story was not played out well. I like how Joe mentioned how the story could be and that would be quite compelling...

If you played spiderman on PS4 - ur helping doc ock the whole time...from the beginning even the you as a player know that he's going to turn bad...but the way they built the character around both of them was soooo good till the end and I wish something like that was done with Ellie and Abby

This is just my opinion and I may be wrong to as I have may missed out a few details while playing but let me know your thoughts!",2021-01-26T10:15:02Z,0,0

Usually, the story wouldn't affect my rating of a game too much, but here, it is so ungodly insulting that it's hard to give it anything more than a 1/10, even with things like the good sound and graphics. I am someone who cares immensely about the story and for me, that can potentially make or break a game. I wouldn't even touch this game with a pole as long as the gap between the edges of the Observable Universe. 






And to those that might call me sexist, homophobic, transphobic and etc for taking umbrage to this game's egregious excuse for a story: I am a pansexual in a homosexual relationship and people like you are an insult to the LGBTQ+ community. Making us look bad because you cannot accept a differing opinion is just downright childish. And for the record: No, I don't hate such people; Rather, I feel CONTEMPT towards them. They're not WORTH anger, they're worth disgust and disdain. 

Also, if you like story, that's fine--even if I think said story's absolutely terrible and deserves scorn for the disservice it does characters like Joel--but that is NO excuse for behaving like this.",2021-01-25T19:33:35Z,0,1

But from both perspective the game was outstanding. Ellie is very cruel and had to grow up which in the ending she did. And about abby killing joel in such a way.(what makes her look so good?????)she killed our only joel which makes her a ho. Abby does realize what she did is wrong and is human aswell, she got her redemption.  Teaming up with joel and ellie could make her see joels perspective and withdrawn from killing them. So that would not work. Ofcourse there  are some bad stuff. But i dont think should rate the game cause of joels death. Good and bad is always a perspective thing since diffrent cultures has diffrent morality.if abby had some general morality , then best thing is to just confront joel without killing.. thats where it was already stated that abby's not sane, does not matter what led to the killing.Ellie did what she had to do to survive in her circumstances, thats why she might look bad. But it was cause of survival.she diddrnt just gun downed abbys squad. She did try to confront them first! i diddent like ellie play through as much as  Abby on the otherhand her story was amazing !

It was even better than the first one. There are only two reasons why this game got all the hate it did. 1. People can‚Äôt get out of their feelings about fictional characters or 2. People are followers and because they heard the hate before playing the game they could not objectively make their own opinion about the game. 

The story was genius. Joel was no Saint and the writers told you that in the first game when he and Ellie were ambushed. The story is showing you that in this world Abby and Ellie are just alike. They will do anything for revenge when it comes to the death of a loved one. The story is to make you hate Abby at first but as time goes you get an understanding as to why she hated Joel and wanted him dead. Also it show how she has empathy when she met Lev and how she is just like Ellie, loving caring but in this world of violence to survive you have to have a dark side. 

This happens all the time in shows ie: the walking dead. This is not a happy go lucky world. It‚Äôs dark and violent just how it would be in real life if the apocalypse came to past. If you were looking for some happy type game you should‚Äôve play Super Mario or something. This game was a masterpiece",2021-01-19T17:52:04Z,1,1

It‚Äôs showing how wrong revenge is no matter what. As it just always hurts both parties. It was not bashing Joel or Ellie. It was showing how no one was the hero and the villain. Joel killed all those people just to selfishly save Ellie. But he isn‚Äôt the villain. However abi killing Joel because that‚Äôs the man that killed all her Freinds and her father isn‚Äôt the villain either. They were actual complex characters dealing with complex emotions. I still love Ellie and Joel. In that final fight I didn‚Äôt want to push the buttons cus I was fed up of them hurting each other. It‚Äôs a story off loss and letting go. And shows the destruction,chaos and pain grudges and revenge cause. It forces you to see it from Abis point of view which was hard for all gamers at first but eventually you have to see the characters for what they are. Which is extremely flawed due to the world they live in. This is more then a game to me and was a true masterclass in Interactable storytelling. Goty for sure.",2021-01-19T16:07:57Z,5,3

Games, movies, shows, they all have their own way of manipulating the viewer to think or feel a certain way. For example, Joel in the first game, he was a very bad guy, and even the game hints that he was a hunter and murdered innocent people when he was ""surviving"" with Tommy after the outbreak, he becomes a psycho killer and he denies the world a vaccine for selfish reasons and even worse, lies to Ellie about it so many times that she ended up hating him even more. But we all ignored that because the game manipulated us to like him, and we do and thats ok! This review is angry just for the sake of being angry at everything. This game wasn't perfect sure but your anger literally gave you a tunnel vision and you missed the beauty, but that's what happens when you expect nothing but to be angry and have a live chat full of toxic kids.

-It will be called ‚ÄúAbby: The Last of Us 3‚Äù

-Ellie dies in the first minute of the game.

-The rest of the game focuses on Abby petting more dogs that die. Jojo style.

-Joel comes back to life as a zombie. Abby kills him again.
She spits on his corpse for at least 12 hours.

-More uncomfortable spicy scenes with Abby. This time they go through the whole kama sutra. Complete with bondage. All other Sony games that are not TLOU will now require their female characters to wear Victorian era clothing.

-Abby finds the cure and saves humanity.

-The game ends with Abby receiving an invitation for Super Smash Bros. And she will not only be the most powerful character in the game, but if you try to pick anyone else, the game will pick Abbie for you. No one can damage Abbie, but Abbie can one shot them. 

-Naughty Dog announces a new game where Nathan Drake is killed by Abby, and the title of the game will be Uncharted 5: The Legend of Abby.",2021-01-13T20:11:50Z,36,654

But I cannot watch them before I play the game as they are basically game recaps full of spoilers. Keep the quality content coming you are one of a handful of reviewers I trust for honest opinion. 

The only thing I disagree with you on is the final score. I believe 7/10 would be more fitting. 10 audio 10 visual 10 gameplay and 2 for story.  But that is just me. 

I only bought last of us part 2 because it got game of the year at VGA and I needed to see how  Ghost could have lost. My suspicion was correct and Ghost by FAR should have won game of the year.",2021-01-13T16:45:35Z,2,0

But I really enjoyed it, and found myself routing for Abby. I thought it was a really interesting philosophical conflict between doing right thing on the personal side (saving Ellie) and the right thing morally (creating the vaccine). I thought the writing of the two colliding vengeance stories with the inevitability and brutality of it was spot on. I thought the evolution of Ellie‚Äôs character was well done: discovering what Joel did would destroy you as a person. And you can see the internal conflict between avenging his death and doing the right thing at the end. One of the only minor flaws I thought was the survival of Joel‚Äôs brother at the end, totally unrealistic and unnecessary. I thought the PTSD was sufficient to launch the final sequence in California. 9/10

I don‚Äôt hate you because of this. But what you thought the message was, wasn‚Äôt at all what ND was trying to tell you. The story isn‚Äôt ‚Äúrevenge is bad‚Äù but it‚Äôs about forgiveness and perspective because 
1. When she says ‚Äúgo... just take him!‚Äù She isn‚Äôt talking about Lev, she‚Äôs talking about Joel because when she has that flashback, she talks about trying to forgive Joel and her letting Abby go was her way of forgiving him. She knew that Joel would never have wanted her to change into someone that she isn‚Äôt. If she killed Abby, then that‚Äôs it. She has completely changed into someone that Joel use to be in the beginning of the first Last of Us. 

Also before you start thinking, ‚Äúbut she killed all those people for nothing‚Äù 

1. You need to realize that they were gonna kill her if she didn‚Äôt kill them.

2. In the first game, Joel decides to change his mind and not let Ellie be used for the cure when the whole entire point of the game was to take her there for the cure. So you‚Äôre basically saying that the first game was a complete waste of time as well.",2021-01-10T15:48:28Z,4,1

Ellie has lost to Abby twice: in the winter episode and in the theatre. This led Ellie to emotional distress. She acquired psychological gestalt because she hadn't won in the fight with Abby. In order to get rid of psychological gestalt, she needed to defeat Abby in the battle. She didn't need to kill her, she just wanted to be a winner in the battle.
Finally, after defeating Abby Ellie's psychological dream came true and she let Abby go. Her psychological gestalt closed. Ellie entered a state of catharsis and after that became desolated.
In the end Ellie visited a farm and forgave Joel. In the last minute of Part 2 we may listen to a tune called 'beyond desolation'.
Therefore Part 2 is not only about forgiveness but also about desolation and catharsis.",2021-01-05T15:28:45Z,2,0

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-sTlYUeT8o,The Last of Us Part II - Angry Review,2020-07-02T02:32:07Z,@TheCookieCook,"Part one of my rebuttal: A good way to start a revenge plot is to get you connected with the characters and then they die in a horrific and tragic way  to the hand of the villain. First of all, how is this predictable? The fact that they ‚Äúspit‚Äù on the character makes both you and Ellie mad. ‚ÄúF@&$ Abbie she killed Joel! I wanna kill that b$&@#!‚Äù And that‚Äôs exactly what you stride out to do. But after you see the other side (Abby‚Äôs story) you start to understand why she killed Joel and her friends are pissed off at him. Now when talks about the ending this is where he starts pissing me off. THE MORAL OF THE WHOLE GAME IS THAT THE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE IS A DEADLY ONE THAT WE SHOULD TRY TO AVOID. What Lev or some other character survived somehow and Ellie killed Abby. It would start all over again right? Then Ellie would die, then Tommy, then Dina, etc.

Part two of my rebuttal: He says playing as Abby is a stupid story concept and the fact that you have to play something you don‚Äôt want to do is stupid. However, I remember a game that made you do something that you didn‚Äôt want to do. Hmm... I think it was called The last of puss or something. Whatever. The point is that in that game you don‚Äôt want humanity to suffer and die but this other character, I think he‚Äôs named Coal, decides last minute to steal an immune girl called Pellie from the operation table against the players (or at least some players) wishes. Overall a narrative where you conceive the actions yourself can state a more profound narrative, but it‚Äôs not the only way to do so.

Part three of my rebuttal: Okay this part is going to be a quicker one because of how dumb the point is. Abby is not treated any different that Ellie. Ellie plays guitar for Dina, Abby plays fetch. Ellie kills all of Abby‚Äôs friends and Abby tries to as well. The parallels are blatantly obvious that it‚Äôs hard to understand if you‚Äôre being serious or not.

Part four of my rebuttal: Did you just step, on a THUMBTACK AND SURVIVE? THIS MUST BE PLOT ARMOR!!!

Part five of my rebuttal: I just played the game and the fact he says ‚Äúshe never shows remorse,‚Äù is the most dog sh#$ lie I‚Äôve ever seen. Throughout the story you see her constantly beating herself up about it. In SEATTLE DAY 1 for Christ sakes- she is talking to Mel and Mel says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a little shook about what happened.‚Äù
Abby replies sarcastically ‚ÄúYeah, cause what horrible person could do such a thing.‚Äù
‚ÄúNo, that‚Äôs not what I-‚Äú

Part 6 of my rebuttal: He says the ally AI do stupid things. Even though the harder the difficulty the less allies are supposed to help in combat. Think about that. He says the ally AI is bad EVEN THOUGH HE SET THE DIFFICULTY THAT WAY.

Part 7 of my rebuttal: He makes fun of how the cards are stupid even though it‚Äôs supposed to be parody. I‚Äôm starting to think he played ‚Äòride to hell‚Äô and not Last of us.

Finally he says that nothing was resolved in the end. I‚Äôve tried to stay polite, BUT DID YOU EVEN SEE THE SAME THING I DID??? Ellie when she is choking Abby ultimately realizes that her final conversation with Joel was a good one, and that when she could no longer play the guitar she was able to let go of the sorrow she felt wasting the years she had left with Joel. Ellie, instead of finding revenge ultimately decides to live the life Joel would have wanted. Instead you tried to fabricate this illusion that the game told a broken story with loose ends. I really hope that he sees his wrongdoings and apologizes to the director Neil Druckman that he bashed and disrespected over and over again in this video.",2021-01-04T21:13:09Z,0,0

I know that we want more Ellie and joel and not abby/yara/lev but won't you think how different it is that you got to play with both protagonist and antagonist in this game, sure it is stretched but story is not that bad or not too good , it is decent though, or what we can expect more from a revenge driven story, even God of war 3 as well fails to deliver us good story but excellent game, the same case is here

I will game the gameplay of this game fucking 20/10 , it is an absolute technical masterpiece, that God level AI which I have seen best after phantom pain, mechanics, fluidity, an absolute finished product. This is what we call the video game, I fucking love every second in my 45 hour play through and I just feel like that this game should keep going on. 

No way this game is 6 , no way Joe no fucking way, atleast you should give It 8.5

I agree with you on most parts of your review. Part 2 was very disappointing specifically in the writing department. While I would have loved to see more of ellie and joel before abbey killed joel I think that for part 2 Abbeys story was way more believable and deep than ellies arc. While I enjoyed joel as a character he is a PIECE OF SHIT. He killed some of the last people on earth who could make a vaccine and save the human race just so he could continue to live out a second chance at being a father figure. And he totally betrayed Ellies trust and continuously overstepped her boundaries. The way joel went out was fucking stupid but he totally had that coming for him. And Abby being the daughter of the doctor who was murdered by joel was a very solid revenge plot in of itself. The revenge plot that made NO SENSE AT ALL was Ellies simply because of the fact she knew about joels betrayal. If ellie found out who abby was and why she did what she did and simultaneously found out that joel lied to her ellie's whole plot of revenge could have turned into her and abby working together to get out of Washington to find the fireflies which would have brought back the whole importance of ellies immunization. But no they totally butchered it. I spent the last act of the game practically pulling my hair out just wanting it to finally be over.",2021-01-01T19:41:36Z,1,0

The theme presented in the game is actually about forgiveness and how taking revenge will just lead to more pain and suffering.

The one that was advertised was awesome because Abbys cannibalistic crew went into Jackson and killed almost everyone and harvested their bodies for food and then moved on towards Seattle. And when Ellie and Joel come back to Jackson and see the carnage, that's when the journey begins and the hunt is on.

Half of what you've spoke of makes literally no sense, so you decide to nitpick at the game at a base value, instead of actually playing the game and understanding the story. I suppose it's just too complex for some to understand. The point of making the WLFS relatable and even making the cult relatable to an extent, is to make sure you know that your actions of killing these people hold heavy consequence, and that this people aren't simply just AI for you to mow down. The relatability with Abbey and the 'no sense' story, is that her dad was murdered and she grew up on lust for revenge.  I could dive further into the story without even having to dig into the story, but I'm wasting my breath at this point.

People dislike the game because Joel dies ‚Äútoo quickly‚Äù. I am so attached to Joel and love him to the point of being just as disappointed as the next guy. BUT to I, like many others with an actual sense of ALL of this story‚Äôs points, it. Made. Sense. Joel killed Abbys father to save ellie (a possible cure for humanity), abbey killed Joel(Joel started this, hes still my favorite person ever tho) and Ellie looks for abbey killing her friends along the way, and Vic versa. Joel sealed his fate when he turned that surgeons blade onto himself. And as for those who  think he shouldve had a heroic death, he kind of did- why would they play out the scene in the most anticipated way just to for you to be satisfied that it happened that way. Joel died as a very rare person that is open and welcoming to strangers that they obviously should‚Äôve been suspicious of, rather than shooting them in the face or causing more tension. He‚Äôs no hero, but you love him still. As long as you realize that Ellie‚Äôs way of revenge was not unwarranted, your not as delusional as those jumping on the bandwagon of hating the game for this reason either. Ellie‚Äôs revenge and anger makes sense as I can refer back to our first impression of her- jumping at us with a knife and the intention of killing us  seeing as Marlene, an ally is wounded with strangers Tess and Joel behind her. We also hear about her teacher upsetting her by calling fireflies terrorists and other incidences. Naughty dog is not trying to make you like Abby and humanize the monster in the way you think they are. Abby was on the same mission as Ellie, and had a full father daughter relationship as they are biologically. And yet, we care more about Joel and Ellie‚Äôs relationship because we spent time with them first (confirmation bias I think it‚Äôs called). If you spent the whole game just as Abby journeying with her father, attaching to them only to have your father and friends murdered and your brotherhoods main objective to save humanity stripped away and in turn, that goal that defines your brotherhood fades away and disbands them because people died uselessly for that cure. The 2 sides 1story could‚Äôve been displayed better as in less confusing, but it was not that bad to hate the entire story. Overall very unfair to give such an objectively good STORY a hard time just because you can‚Äôt understand the deeper meanings. Which is clear and rightfully so when your judgement is clouded by Joel‚Äôs sudden death- a single aspect of the game that was done with many other characters in many other highly liked stories. This proves that the negative reaction of Joel‚Äôs death is the most emotionally provoking event ever seeing that there has never been this much hate because of it. Yes you could argue that‚Äôs because you think it‚Äôs actually stupid, but if you remember lees death from the walking dead, he died in the first game and was liked probably just as much as Joel or even more(lees was more saddening then angering. Hey, Ellie‚Äôs pretty angry too)",2020-12-25T17:44:43Z,2,0

All your points are subjective and can easily be debatable.
This game is really bold and the message is very clear. Violence only generates more violence.
The fact that you didn't understand or agreed with the decision of Ellie in the and of the game baffles me.

And Abby is an extremely well-done character. All her background and motivations are there and very well established.
It's a shame you didn't get her either.

Anyway, keep up the good work. I'll keep watching.

Joel  dying that fast by Abby was unexcepted.  You work hard to get Ellie power levels up then you're switch to Abby with no level up so now you got to start over again with her.  Then flashbacks on top of flashbacks, constantly dealing with way too many dark rooms and limited flashlight. Overall I'll give them a lot of credit with voice acting, emotional facial display, beautiful game, the graphic are incredible it plays like a movie.  I think the long anticipation, the characters we got used to, all changed and the story line at times makes no since.  I guess the writers are giving us Ellie and Abby  at a point of view of good and evil.  They both have loving caring ways, but they both can also become very dark and neither one seems to have a problem with killing.

We start off as abby, living her life with her dad, with the fireflies, so we build a relationship with them. 

Then her dad is killed, but where, or by who unknown to us.

Cut to Ellie, shes with joel and Tommy, eventually learning about how joel lied to her. Angry, she leaves town to live by herself.

She and abby meet, and overtime they become friends, and one day ellie learns abby is out hunting for someone called Miller, who turns out to be joel.
Finally, abby captures joel, and ellie is given a choice, either let abby have her revenge, or help joel.

If the first is picked, game ends, if second, then the rest is spent focusing on the fight between Tommy's group and the WLF, during which most of abbys friends die.

In the end, joel is left fatally wounded, and ellie and abby fight, again we are given a choice.

If we have abby win, she kills joel and ellie, but then realizes that she was now completely alone and without purpose, so driven by revenge she didn't value what she still had when it was around.

If ellie won, she kills abby, and joel dies peacefully in her arms as she says she forgives him. She then rejoins Tommy in rebuilding the town after the battle.


There, that took me like.....two minutes to come up with. Naughty Dog had *Y E A R S* and this is what we end up with?

I tried to stay away from spoilers and controversies and I thought -and hoped- the game got all that hate because there's a woman with huge muscles in it. I also thought Abby was trans and that was the reason why so many people hated her. ""They are just bigots, I'm sure the game is awesome."" But no, that wasn't it at all. To be clear, I liked the game and I kinda cared about Abby sometimes. The story is not badly written in general, but it misfires when it matters. And I get the point is trying to make, but it didn't get to me. I didn't want to fight Ellie in the theater and I didn't want to fight Abby in the beach, but the game forced me to do it just to tell me it's wrong. The first game didn't give us choices either, but I cared so much about Ellie that I wanted to kill all those Fireflies just to save her.

Almost an hour long and doesn't address any of the actual gameplay. I am not saying that story and characters don't matter. A game needs good story and good characters to be great. That being said, it's a GAME. Not a movie, not a painting and not a book. It needs to be a good game first. And that's what I hate about this game the most. It's basically the sneak to the next cut scene game. Even the combat is mostly cutscenes. But noone is talking about this. Instead everyone is regurgitating this crap that everyone already agrees with. Boo hoo, I don't like the story. The point of the story is that you are not the good guys. There are no good guys. Any adult should be able to figure this out. Again, I'm not saying it's a good game, but stories are not meant to always be satisfying and uplifting. I don't like the story either, but I understand it. The real problem with this game is how incredibly easy it is and how you are not an agent but a spectator.",2020-12-07T12:46:57Z,4,1

Step 1 TLOU: Marlene is Riley‚Äôs mom
Step 2 Left Behind: Riley‚Äôs fate unknown
Step 3 TLOU2: replace Abby with Riley.
Include the missing part where Abby joins the community after Joel saves her. This creates internal struggle for Riley, she ultimately kills Joel and thus begins the plot for Ellie. The story ends with the fight in the building, the player decides who to play and once victorious choose death or mercy. Leave out the last part where Ellie hunts Abby and ends at the boat dock. Credits roll after the family reunion sitting on the tractor.

I'm not gonna pretend that there isn't sexist homophobic people who hated the game metacritic review are full of reviews hating on Ellie for being gay (even though she was in the first games dlc) and people hated the game before it even released because they assumed abby was trans ( because it's impossible for woman to be buff?) I'm not gonna pretend this game didn't get alot of extra hate because it tackled some more social justice related issues but Im not gonna act like everyone who disliked the game disliked it for that reason. Everyone's entitled to their opinion. That being said I disagree on all accounts with people who didn't like this game.

Joel lost his daughter, Tess and was about to lose Ellie by no fault of his own. However Abby's friends brought it onto themselves and I honestly wasn't sad when Owen, Mel, Nora and Manny were killed, because if they had not murdered Joel they would have lived. Owen and Mel could have survived, had Owen not tried to snatch the gun from Ellie's hands. 

I honestly did not like Abby's father either, no good doctor ever tries to kill a patient no matter how dire the situation is. Moreover he was just plainly dishonest, he didn't want to tell Joel that he was operating on Ellie, if it wasn't for Marlene, Joel would not have known what they were about to do to Ellie.

Carl Motherfucking Grimes from the Walking Dead comic. When I saw that his character wasn't going anywhere in the show and they were just wasting him and giving his development to other characters I said. ""If you ain't going to do anything with him. You might as well kill him off."" When they did kill him off in the show I was pissed about how they killed one of my favorite characters. But at the same time, I can't complain because at least they ain't wasting his character anymore and that's why should happened to Ellie.

It felt like the gameplay had actually improved from the first one. I personally would have preferred Joel not to die but playing with Abby was kind of nice to be honest.. She was brutal in her combat style and her finishes felt cool to execute. I don't understand what is that people are trying to criticize so much about the game? That Joel died? Ok yes I loved him as well but it gives another spin to the story whatever.. that you play as Abby? Tell me it wasn't nice her gameplay style and the weapons she had?

The whole sparring lives thing is lost when you go on a murder spree. Pacing was jarring at times. Deffo would have had better reception if the event were reordered. I don't agree with the manipulation criticism. Surely all writers do things so that the player likes the character? Seems like NG wanted to flip the players from hating Abby to wanting here to live in the final boss battle. 

The whole thing about painting Abby as not a bad person kinda has same parallels to Negan in The Walking Dead imo. When he kills Glen, but points out to Rick they killed so many of his men. They aren't really any good guys, but it's understandable that players could not side with Abby. People loved Joel too much to care.

However gameplay improved loads with better AI, crawling, grass and crafting silencers. The mini open world section, that we've had in Uncharted before, was great.

When I finished the game I just felt drained, reflecting on all that happened and that Ellie was seemingly left with nothing. It's quite weird. I didn't like the ending and I didn't hate it.",2020-11-22T03:21:29Z,0,2

Joel dying is one thing, Ellie and Abby's story is another thing, but my main problem is how the media protected this game at all costs, and told us, we the gamers, that we don't know anything. 

Any and all negative attitudes toward this game was subjected to ""review bombing"",  and labeled as ""misogynistic/homophobic/transphobic/intolerant/insensitive."" When we all bought and enjoyed Last of us 1 we were loyal fans, but now that 2 has been completely polarized due to it's own political agenda, we've all become intolerant assholes years later.

 This game is no martyr, it was just another cog in the machine of constant politicization of all forms of media and entertainment, so it could root out all of the ""bigots"". It was only a matter of time before we weren't allowed to ""have fun"", (according to druckmann) and had to pay attention to forced political agenda, then told we are the problem.

- The Last Of Us 2 should've been 24h long but the first 12 hours would've been Abby and her Dad in the 20 years of the outbreak. We dont know who these characters are and assume Joel and ellies stories are done until the mid-game climax which intetwines both stories. Abby, during this time, would be young and growing up, her Mum dies in this time leaving just her and her Dad surviving day by day until they join the fireflies and a mini story couldve been about them travelling to different parts of the country to collect immune kids for experimentation (giving us backstory on these other immune kids) which don't work but eventually leads the doctor to a conclusion that it could finally work if they had one more immune person, but they need to remove the cordyceps from the brain. Marlene then reveals she knows Ellie and she'll get someone (Joel and Tess) to smuggle them. She states that she trusts Joel a lot because she knew his brother and knows Joel's backstory with Sarah so she knows this guy will protect Ellie with his life but doesn't consider him growing to love her. We then jump to when Abby finds her Dad dead. Ending that chapter of the game and waking up in the present day with the remaining fireflies group. 
- They've got a mission and that's to find Joel, they finally get info after the long years from those fireflies at the wall (who said Tommy lived in Wyoming) and prepare to go across the country in hope Joel might be there or Tommy knows where he is (this would be the final 12 hours of the game). Then we would be travelling with her group to Wyoming. Losing some on the way but ultimately at the end we get there and the game ends on the point when Owen reveals ""this is it, were here"" revealing Jackson and he says ""so, you ready to do this?"". Abby is silent and looks at him and just says ""Okay"" like Ellie in the first game and before gazing off at Jackson in the distance and the game ends. Which would be an ironic end for the game. Perfectly setting up Part 3.",2020-11-04T19:08:40Z,0,1

If Joel didn‚Äôt die so soon and they played it our like you said it would have been good.

Feeling empathy, anger, love and hatred you should have at some point felt for Ellie, felt for Abby, disconnected from both, but in the end hoped for neither to die (my opinion). No other game I've ever played had me on edge throughout the whole playthrough like tlou2. It was hard to play in a sense I've never experienced before. I really don't know how anybody could question the story telling. It shows you how actions can have a massive impact if you act on selfish reasons, having the fear of loosing someone, the effects of suffering from ptsd, how you can loose everything even though you had won the battle, how a single good choice can redeem yourself. And, it shows you how experiences can change a person. As spectator you hoped that Ellie stays that cheeky and joyful girl from the first part and that she's going to be accompanied by Joel on their journeys. But that was taken and it's how things work in every aspect of life... they don't last. I'm sorry for everyone who couldn't experience the game like i did. It's going to be hard to get used to other story-driven games, because tlou2, in my opinion sets a new standard of immersion into a video game based story.

For me and many other people it's different. The story was way more stronger than what he said and I feel like he lost the game after Joel's death. 
I think leaks destroyed this game like we were all okay before the leaks with Abby's body and Ellie being gay but after the leaks people ended up hating this game without even being released! That doesn't make any sense.
That's exactly what happened to Joe. Joe entered this game already having a bad shitty background about it. I protected myself from spoilers and I had no idea who these characters are and what's about to happen and this game ended up my best experience ever in any sort of media.
There are some flaws of course there are some flaws. Flaws can be found in any games and stories but these flaws are not gonna change how good the story is.
It's just... let's be honest this story is not for everyone including Joe.
Don't misunderstand me, I love Joe. I enjoyed the review and I watched it completely with every single cell in my body screaming ""get rid of this nonsense!"" but that's alright. I'm not gonna blame anyone for having an opinion.",2020-10-22T16:47:11Z,1,2

Like, you killed what you built up so much for nothing. If he was going to die it should've maybe been later or in the end. Why should I play the rest of this trainwreck when you've literally made the beginning so miserable to endure for the player? Even if you try to justify it by explaining the scenario afterwards, what's the point? You marketed this shit around these two and you killed one of them within the first 2 hours in a horrible way, with 30 hours left to play?

I'm sorry, but the whole core point of playing games is to enjoy the journey. To have fun, even if it is dark or scary or tragic. After waiting 7 years and then seeing Joel get fucked in the first 2 hours, I simply stopped having fun, and enjoying this game.

This was one of the best and most interesting story lines ever told in video game form. Joel was a piece of shit and I wondered how they would make a compelling story after his turn to evil at the end of the first game.

After Ellie set Abby and Lev free and realized that killing Abby wouldn‚Äôt bring Joel back her story is pretty much done with.

So many people praised the first game for doing simple shit well in a medium with very low standards for narrative, and the creators began to believe their own hype, that what they were doing was somehow more than an example of the early 2010's gaming trend of trying to integrate an HBO-style narrative into the gaming medium. I'd hoped this game's failings would cause people to look back and realize that the first game wasn't really that much of an achievement to begin with and had writing issues that actually persist into its sequel, but instead it seems to have only caused people to look back with rose-tinted glasses on what was always a simple story, paced well - that utterly falls apart at the end.",2020-10-17T15:00:32Z,0,0

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-sTlYUeT8o,The Last of Us Part II - Angry Review,2020-07-02T02:32:07Z,@STHUltra,"Imagine if you will: the game opens up and you play as Abby as a child, her relationship with her father is built up more, you get a few chapters of them surviving together. You hide the fact that he is the doctor Joel killed. You bring the feeling of when we played as Sarah, and play on the fact that at that time she is a helpless girl, someone who needs others. And then you are evacuating a local town and find that her father was killed. She wishes she could have been stronger. That she could have protected him. Cut back to her 4 years later, dealing with the events of the game before killing Joel (with better writing and characters that we can root for),now physically stronger and kind to others, but she has the obsession of killing her father‚Äôs murderer and constantly bring other people into her problems. All they know is that her father was a doctor and Abby leads them on thinking that they are gonna go check on a settlement they have been hearing of. Then after getting to know her we have the confrontation, Abby‚Äôs group doesn‚Äôt know Joel is the murderer and right there Abby draws a gun on him, she tells him to remember what he did. Only for Joel to reveal to Elle that he lied to save her life. Half of abby‚Äôs group is furious at joel while the other is angry that Abby lead them on, possibly starting war. But Joel wants this to end. That he has had thoughts about what he has done for someone he loves, thinks that this is karma for it. He tells Abby that she can kill him only if she lets Ellie and Tommy go. She asks why as he killed her father. And he tells her it‚Äôs what our dead loved ones would want. He looks at Tommy and makes him promise him that he will keep Ellie safe to which he agrees, then looks at Ellie telling her to not look for revenge, then tells her ‚ÄúI love you baby girl‚Äù and are now given the promt to pull the trigger as Abby. You hear the trigger pull, and it‚Äôs a black screen (no brutal beating). You are now playing as Joel and Ellie, you play a few chapters of their journey back to tommy. You see that Joel is still the same although quite disturbed when faced with the infected. He gets overprotective of Ellie and is constantly getting upset over her carefree attitude, feeling that her happiness is false since the cure won‚Äôt be made. He gets close once to telling her and can‚Äôt bring it out, and decides to bury it. We go through her birthday, her finding love with Dima (who I would give more of a personally to so that she stands out as a supportive character) and we then get back to the death scene. Joel gave his goodbye and now Ellie freaks out since Joel died and then the one guy actively spits on Joel‚Äôs face for dooming humanity, to which Ellie immediately shoots him dead. Tommy fights off the other guys while Ellie gives chase to Abby, not seeing that the phrase Joel said was something her father would tell her and made Abby cry, almost as if she became the monster that Joel became trying to protect Ellie. Ellie gets lost in the snow storm screaming ‚ÄúI will kill you‚Äù as the curten closes. 

I feel like the last of us 3 should have been Ellie‚Äôs story of revenge and how she chooses to disobey Joel‚Äôs last wish and how Tommy doesn‚Äôt wanna get revenge. Plus showing Abby kill Joel first would never make us like her since we have a whole game with Joel to understand how he thinks instead of giving us a horrible first impression and doing everything to make us like her. It‚Äôs not how narratives work. You can‚Äôt show Ned stark getting killed and then show us how good Geoffrey is. Because that is an established character and establishing a character by killing beloved character does not make us think ‚ÄúI wonder how that character thinks?‚Äù It makes us hate that character.",2020-10-16T23:33:36Z,0,0

Being on the drivers seat of Ellies descent into darkness felt so real (specially with the hole in the stomach we all had after Joels death). This character is such a badass.. Loved the Nora scene in the hospital... And Ellies body language after that... Just great...
On the other hand Abby's ascent into light (from a self centered revenge seeking woman to a selfless human being) is also well crafted....
Still can't understand how people wanted Ellie to drown Abby... That act of mercy is what she needed to forgive Joel and herself (she fucking killed a pregnant woman ffs).
Hated the creative decision of killing Joel but loved the way Naughy Dog shone a light into both characters humanity... If you want a safe Heroe/Villain revenge story go watch a Van Damme movie....

It's too obvious that you are upset because they didn't write a story for you... It reminds me of the end of Dexter controversy.
Joel was generally a good guy be he did some really dark shit, he killed a ton of people and he killed the only man that could create a cure for the infection... so if you expect something like that to just float away, then you are literally thinking about a dreamland
I see this as a story of how revenge poisons the soul of anyone, and the idea is that at the very end Ellie realizes that what she's doing is not going to stop her nightmares but probably make them worse.
They show you Abby in her best moments because in the previous game (and also a lot in this one) we saw Ellie in her best moments, it's two sides of the same coin.
So yeah, basically what I hear here is rage about your favorite character getting something he should have been expecting to get eventually.",2020-10-09T19:08:45Z,1,3

We all know if this was the first game Joel would kick all their asses.

Though I personally wouldn't have killed off Joel,  and especially like that its just too morbid and depressing, rather would like to see more story between him and Ellie like a father /daughter bonding while they adventure that would of been a masterpiece even better than the first game, but so many reviews state the last of us 1 is better than 2, simply because of many flaws the sequel had like wandering around there's no proper map so you end up time wasting and then there's flash backs and all you do is just wander around more to get the story up, and this happens a lot frequently , while the first game has replay value  the sequel doesn't its just too long a lot of sections of the game is empty with no combat.",2020-10-05T11:47:47Z,0,1

Gamers have no respect for developers and if something is not a masterpiece to them they hate on the game and the developers. That‚Äôs why very few gamers get higher than a 9 for the user score. Like I don‚Äôt know why some people play video games if they get this mad over the story in a game. Some people just don‚Äôt deserve video games.,2020-10-05T05:40:16Z,0,1

I think when the dust settles and once we've had years to play this game, more people will appreciate it for what it is and not for what people expected it to be. I think there is an issue within the gaming community where people feel they are entitled to ""their"" game. I will agree that the last of us 2 marketing the game with Joel was a bad idea but I don't think they had a choice (business-wise), bc in the beginning it did look like they weren't trying to market Joel at all. I do think if Joel plays the game again he might have a different opinion about the game, bc a lot of his hate has to do with his expectations not being met. I commend Naughty Dog bc I know they knew a lot of gamers will hate it and they did it anyway. This game is about coping with hate and it's ironic that it resulted in A LOT of hate in the gaming community. I don't resent anyone who hates the game at all. If you don't like all I can say is that I encourage you to play it again someday and see if your opinion changes.

The Abby playthrough was designed to make the players see that Abbie had her own the last of us 1 and has just as much emotional validity as the ""main"" characters. I understand it is hard for people to make that emotional transition from being totally in Ellie's shoes to having to walk a mile in Abby's. 
But I think that is where the game shines, it's a wonderfully complex and introspective story on dealing with trauma, loss, and revenge. It forces the player to question their own morality and confront their own bias of perspective.
 It would be kind of boring if the dynamic still stayed the same as TLOU1 where Joel and Ellie go around fighting zombies. I definitely don't think it's perfect, but I also don't agree with the over-simplification of the story line to ""they are just trying to spit on Joel"" or ""Abby shouldn't be in the game"".",2020-10-01T17:27:07Z,3,1

6/10? Really? In your own words: ""Are you out of your mind???""
Honestly, the graphics and gameplay are second to the story and cutscenes, a sequel, regardless of whether its a book, movie, video game, or whatever else, should make sense to the world and story the first of the series establishes first.
The uncomfortable sex scene, the brutal and unjust death of Joel, the uninteresting new cast, the complete butchering of established characters, and the over-abundance of deus-ex machinas should force the rating to take massive hits on their own.
You go through this entire video, doing almost nothing but complaining about this video game, then give it a SIX? Are you shitting me???

A much more fitting rating would be a 2/10, and that's being generous. The game ruins everything and completely goes back on everything the first stood for just so Niel's shitty mary sue OC could have the best ending with no consequences. Don't tell me that's not true, because you say it yourself in this video. Abby gets everything, she gets out scot-free, she gets her revenge, she finishes her mission, bites off Ellie's fingers, and gets a happy ending, leaving Ellie with NOTHING. I mean, for crying out loud, she's such a mary sue that she even gets a graphic sex scene in a series owned by a company that normally heavily censors that shit!

The graphics, the gameplay, customizable huds and all seem fine, but you can't just ignore the core part of what made the original good, and the thing that made everyone love that game. The story and characters is what made the original stand out from the crowd of generic zombie shooters, as you and pretty much everyone else have already stated. SO WHY, IN THE NAME OF ALL THAT IS HOLY, WOULD YOU IGNORE THAT ASPECT SO MUCH IN YOUR GODDAMNED RATING???? WHY?????",2020-09-30T21:20:32Z,2,5

There was a segment where an enemy simply stood still at an edge, looking at the helper slightly below for several dozen seconds (combat mode engaged, by the way), whilst the helper missed dozens of shots at the enemy, both of them standing completely still.

If things were done at a different order, if they didn‚Äôt work so hard to try to subvert how we felt about Elle and Joel, if they stopped giving every single enemy we killed a name, if they didn‚Äôt put fucking dogs in the game that we had to kill because they would‚Äôve killed us, just maybe the game would have been far more playable with a better paced story.

I‚Äôll never play the single player again. Seems like nobody cares that they shit on all the fans that loved the relationship from the first game. The way they took Joel was lazy, was insulting, and was unrealistic. Joel survived for over 20 fucking years. And he would‚Äôve NEVER gone to a camp full of armed strangers like that. I never thought I‚Äôd see the day that Naughty Dog let me down to this point, but they made the best game ever in the first one. The story was unlike anything I‚Äôve ever experienced. And then lied about the game multiple times in all the trailers for the game, and mislead everyone into thinking Joel would be in it for the most part. And edited him into cutscenes that he wasn‚Äôt actually in. That is false advertising and it‚Äôs disgraceful. They basically said fuck you and everything you loved about the first game. The last of us ‚Äúwas‚Äù about Ellie and Joel. That was the core mechanic. It revolves around them, and their journey together. How they grew together. How they needed each other to survive, and grow. Not only as survivors, but as individuals that had a broken past. They could‚Äôve EASILY continued that in a more mature way since Ellie is an adult. The potential was RIGHT FUCKING THERE!!!




What happened? What.. the fuck.. happened... Kill Joel under two hours of gameplay like he was a fucking npc that nobody cared about, with no justice or closure. The character everyone loved so dearly, just gone... Gone... 
Leaving a gaping, empty hole in our hearts for the rest of the game. Numb. And then to make us play as the cunt that killed him for over half the game. And THEN to have Ellie not even go through with killing her at the end. Not even give us the satisfaction of a fucking CHOICE if we wanted to kill her. The ending had NO closure, made NO sense, and felt fucking EMPTY... I will always feel depressed every time I think of this game... I still do. And everywhere I look, nobody seems to care. Just goes to show, you can have a AAA game that looks and plays fucking amazing! But is nothing if it‚Äôs lazy, hollow and heartless.",2020-09-27T03:50:05Z,0,1

I beat the game, I'm not gonna argue that the story is amazing. I myself wasn't thrilled with it, but tbh as engaging  as 1st game's story was, and as much as I loved Joel as a character, it was pretty cheap from a story telling perspective so idk why people are just waking up to this. Tons of emotional bate, and awful things happen because ""end of the world."" Some of it made sense, some times it didn't IMO. Like why would you kill the only living sample for the cure. It seems very rushed, when they could've taken more years to study Ellie. So imo, though I think it was a good ending, the ending of the first game always felt forced to end on a somber note and to sell the point even further that Ellie was Joel's surrogate daughter. For game that was supposed to feel grounded, it really didn't. The 6/10 score for this game I don't get. I lost a lot of respect for you.  I've always went to your channel for your opinion, because in the past it felt unbiased. But you let me down here. Having watched your review, and played and beat the game, btw it's definitely not a 10/10 for me, it seems you made your mind up before you gave the review. ""You had one job!"" The game play, level design, and ai are huge leap forward for the last of us, and the only things that let me down were the pacing and the story. That being said, I buy games for gameplay, sometimes I'm willing to overlook lukewarm gameplay when the narrative is strong, I sort of did this for the first game, and the I definitely had no problem with the Wither 3 because everything else was so amazing.

Even if a beloved character was killed off there, at least it was a noble sacrifice that saved lives, and it came with a cool final stand. And yes, the whole war with the First Order was ultimately not very progressed but the characters at least still grew; Poe grew to be a better leader, and less reckless, Fynn in the end wanted to sacrifice himself instead of only caring about Rey like he did before, and Ben ALMOST (before the Rise of Skywalker ruined that) completely let go of his obsession with Vader and looked for having no Masters, and it wasn't even completely for selfish reasons, he grew to care about Rey. More character progression was done in that movie, while this game is trying to tell a deep, compelling story out of characters NOT growing and instead destroy themselves. FUCKING RICK AND MORTY, is doing a better story out of Rick refusing to change while his family grows to be better people!!!!!!",2020-09-25T13:49:30Z,0,0

Huge Last of Us fanboy here. Back in 2013 when it came out, it instantaneously became my favorite game of all time, the be-all, end-all of the gaming industry as it left me speechless and emotionally involved like no other form of art/media had before. I just finished the game and, despite not taking the direction that I was expecting on a narrative standpoint, it is shockingly tragic as it is beautiful. A worthy sequel, that left me scared, forcing me to drop the controller when the end credits started to roll, go outside and reminisce on the spectrum of emotions I just went through. The same feeling Ellie and Joel left me 7 years ago.

I don‚Äôt understand the staggering hate and ridiculous negativity this game is getting, but I‚Äôll respect anyone‚Äôs opinion regarding the game. As for myself, thank you Naughty Dog for this masterfully crafted piece of art.",2020-09-21T11:47:29Z,1,2

Why didn't just make Abby forgive Joel instead Ellie forgive that She-hulk bitch.

Make it like this. 
Ellie always dreaming to had a sister. So Abby come to her life. Joel, Ellie, and Abby becomes a wonderful trio on the journey. Joel also love Abby as his own daughter.
But later on the story, they all finds out that Joel killef abby's dad. Abby really want to revenge and kill Joel but she cannot because she loves Ellie.
So Abby left the crew.

Somehow, I too lazy to think how. But somehow, Abby left the crew make a cause that threaten Ellie and Joel's life. So she cameback to save them.

And at the end, Joel sacrifices his life to safe both Ellie and Abby.
And his last word to Abby is
""I know even in death you will never forgive me. But please allow me to sacrifice my life for you""


I know I am not expert in story writing.
But please. Stop denying and say TLoU2 is delivered this forgiveness or whatever messages PERFECTLY.

Also, a woman is injured with a gunshot wound, can push bookshelves and take on 15 stone men on her own and still come out top. What utter crap is that? It is impossible. The story signposts where it was going, all female strong characters and weak men. Even joe becomes weak in Lof U 2 for god's sake.",2020-09-20T02:31:55Z,0,0

If they wrote it better, perhaps made it much farther in that Joel dies; made us actually like Abby, I would have enjoyed it. We could have been on a mission to 'save' Joel, not knowing if he was alive or dead, not known who had taken him.

In the case of most games the list of most to least important goes game play fallowed closely by level design, a bit further back is characters and then graphics and story bring up the rear about a mile back. The reasons being it doesn't matter how other wise weak or generic a story is or how good the graphics are when the reason you would want to see the story thru to the end is how compelling the characters are. Then it doesn't matter how much you like the characters if the world you explore is horribly designed and the gameplay sucks. 

That's how it normally is anyways. In the case of a narrative based game where half the game is story then the story and characters become just as if not more important than the gameplay cause it's not going to matter how fun the game is to play when the narrative you've put some much emphasis on sucks and the characters are vapid irritating dill holes you wish death on!

Like they just had to get rid of every character from the last game as well as new characters that I couldn't really get invested in because either they weren't in the game itself very much and would only pop up here or there only to run off/disappear again, or the characters didn't have much development behind them and I honestly couldn't find it in me to care about them.",2020-09-07T23:14:16Z,1,12

I found the game was really good not quite as good as the first one but it was still very solid. It maintains the severity of the first game , anyone can die at any time, just like these kind of post-apocalyptic games should be.  Am I bummed that Joel died, of course. And I bummed by how he died also how quick, of course. But an immensely amazing job was done making you care about this story. Especially towards the end. Or at least it did for me. I actually thought Abby was a good character and fun to play as. You empathize for her because what Joel and Ellie did to her was screwed up. He didn't need time spent caring about Ellie or Joel, You already did from the first game. Abby wasn't a transgender Like everyone tries to make out. She was a really buff tough militant chick. This was shown with her flashback with her father and tracking down the pregnant deer, where she looked pretty much like a normal athletic girl. Also her love story. I think the helplessness brought on by her father's death made her want to become overly strong and protect those she cares about. shown by the haunting dream she has walking down the hallway when she first discovered her dad's body. This dream in my opinion explains the muscles. I personally thought they did a good job of making you see the WOLFS were actually just normal people trying to survive. Just like all the people from Jackson. Reminding you what Joel did and how he did it was  messed up. But they show through Abby's story that she does exactly the same thing. Her story with Lev mirrors Joel and Ellie's story. Which in my opinion redeems Joel. This is why I feel Abby ultimately doesn't finish Ellie after all her friends and the love of her life were killed by her. When you love something you'll turn on anyone and do unspeakable things to protect them.( I have to disagree with many of the haters of this game it was really well done). One of the better games of this generation. For me, God of war and RD2 are still the best but this comes really close. Almost perfect.",2020-09-05T15:52:51Z,0,0

(In my opinion) I felt his mindset before playing knowing the leaks/Sonys taking down videos severely altered his opinion therefore he didn't have an open mind about every facet of the story. He simply chalked it up to ""Bad writing that doesn't make any sense and everything bad that happens is only done for shock value that disrespects beloved characters in favor for new characters that no one gives a shit about that reminds me of the new star wars Trilogy and that makes me even more angry.""

Which don't get me wrong may very well be a sound critism...but I'd beg to differ when it seems like you only have a one track mind when playing the game without ever once contemplating why certain actions were taken in the game.",2020-09-05T13:44:16Z,1,4

She lost all her friends, and she ended up bring considered a traitor by the WLF. How do you consider that a positive outcome?
Besides that, I think Joel's death was earned given the fact that Ellie as well as his life in Jackson softened him up and he ended being a little less careful than he was in the first game. Joe, with all due respect, you're not a writer. I don't think you should be telling the man who wrote the Last of Us as well as the Uncharted games how to write a story. Gameplay was definitely improved from the first game.

Is that all it takes to make a slightly above average game, good graphics? It destroyed what had the potential to be one of the greatest franchises of all time. It decimated some of the greatest video game characters of recent memory, and pushed and agenda that left a bad taste in everyone's mouth. I don't care how good the graphics are, if what those graphics are used to show is horrific and broken on a fundamental level. 3/10 for me, at the absolute highest. Good graphics, good visuals, do not a good product make. There is a reason people can still go back and play WoW, Skyrim, Fall Out: New Vegas, Deus Ex: Human Revolution, and so many others, despite their graphics aging heavily with time. Its because the gameplay and story come together and create an experience that doesn't NEED good graphics to be enjoyable. Graphics will always age. The best looking game today will look awful twenty years from now. But story? The characters and world we've grown to love and remember? Those are timeless. I don't think this game should get a pass for looking beautiful. Because eventually? It wont look beautiful at all, but its story will be just as ugly as the day it was released.

But also Ellie was not herself or like how I know her, lying to her friends about the true nature of her vengeance mission. And killed dogs. And doing things for the wrong reasons. So I think it was appropriate that Ellie ""got nothing"" throughout the game. Ellie letting the bitterness take over while Abby managed to get rid of it in due time.  And the ending yeah I get it what was it all for but I felt like I got Ellie back and after some time I've come to like it. Ellie did win - over herself. I too wanted to play the characters from the first game, and did expect another experience.

Gameplay - part 2 does have better gameplay, besides being prone they have made the dodge system more formalised and melee feels good... for ellie, for abby the system feels clunkier then the first game and less intense. They do a better job with safes however making you use enviromental clues after the first few, they could use one or two more near the end of the game but considering how under utalized they were in the first game I can't complain. As for puzzles while the rope puzzles can be fun they all but disappear about halfway through and the other puzzles barely make any apperance in the game esspecially the ladder and swiming ones. Something else now massivly underutilized is armour, clickers still have it but I cant remember a single human enemy with any armour and only found out clickers sometimes wear kevlar with the model viewer. There are also a ton of scripted events on the side for you to be suprised by... in the first half of the game, being suprised by some enemies in a scripted event in a side building with a workbench was a shock.

To me it makes sense. Tell me did you question Joel when he literally slept in the same room as Sam and Henry people he barely met? Probably not. So clearly Joel is a nice guy when it comes to trusting people who he's saved. He had just saved Abby, who is about the same age as Ellie, he had literally no reason to not trust her. Not to mention it is literally referenced that this is not the first time he has helped a person who isn't from Jackson. This whole game is about Joel. The fact that people say this game humiliates Joel, that's a complete lie. Joel in this game is the complete opposite of a bad guy. We see how much he's changed right at the start. He is older and laid back. We get the museum scene where we see how much Joel has grown, hell he's even cracking his own jokes. His death is probably the most criticized. Joel wasn't ""stupid"" he was naive to think his past wouldn't eventually going to catch up to him. He knows this when he's on the floor staring at the people who are about to end his life. He realises right then and there that this is how he's gonna die and this is what happens when you trust people. He then proceeds to say the most badass last words probably ever ""why don't you say whatever speech you've got rehearsed and GET THIS OVER WITH""

NO! We all love Joel, but doesn't matter how much you love him, he is not invencible, he is human and might die with a simple fucking clicker or a shot, like everyone else, man...
This was a story about vengence...ON BOTH SIDES, and the story of what happened and how the stories and choices of Joel on the first game, affect the 2nd game. If you hadn't played as Abby and understood her and what drove her to kill Joel, the Joel's death would have been meanigless, pointless and rushed.
The game tells a story of vengence and how everything scaled up to the point of Joel's death and to the last cutscene.
Everything doesn't have to go according to your wishes and desires and if you think like that you're an immature mofo.
It's a beautiful game that plays with your emotions and tells a story of Hate...and it was done beautifully.
No one cared about Yara or Lev...they were just there to make the player realise that Abby also had a good human side to her...JUST FOR THAT you dumb twat.
Joel also tortured people before but because WE love him, we ''forgive'' or ''see no harm in that'' just the same way that if Ellie had killed Abby like she killed Joel, we would all cheer for that...because you LOVE and UNDERSTAND and AGREE with them and their choices. Abby part was so the player UNDERSTANDS HER damn it.

Really?? It's a VIDEO GAME and you're an ADULT. Also, the part right after saying that Abby has all of  the ""fun"" weapons. Uhhh...Ellie has explosive arrows and ELLIE is the one with the Molotov cocktails. Ellie is also the one who has a switch blade that never breaks. She also has useful trap mines and the silenced sub-machine gun which are awesome. I couldn't listen to this review anymore after that...I was trying to because I wanted to listen to a ""negative"" review of the game, out of curiosity, even though I loved Part Two. 

 The first game is great, but no one looks at it like, ""What the hell...you mean I just did all this for nothing because there's no cure after my whole point was to get Ellie to the fireflies?! What a waste of time!"" 
Part One is dark, brutal and ultimately sad...there isn't really a happy ending in it; just the notion that things will go on the same. Joel dying was going to happen no matter what; revenge exacted by someone, somewhere because of all his transgressions. I didn't want him to die either and I was reluctant to play as Abby at first. This was the intent of the writing. Not everyone will like it. I've seen the comments on here where apparently the reviewer was saying, ""Just because you explain things doesn't make it good.""  Actually, it does. Whether you agree with it or not, they succeeded in making a story that makes sense. People make choices in the story that they are allowed to make. When you DON'T explain things and a story is convoluted; THAT is bad writing. If you explain them, but you still don't want to like what happened, then that doesn't make the writing bad or the game bad. It's like art...it's subjective, but when I create art and can explain my intentions behind something: that validates it far more than not being able to defend my work. They wanted to make something provocative...and they succeeded. Just like art; if I wanted you to feel angry when you look at an image, then I have succeeded in my execution. 

The story is depressing, yes, but that doesn't make it a bad game. It makes it more realistic, in my opinion, to not give people some ""grand"" death. It's real in the sense that people tend to be killed quickly and die either alone or not get a chance to go out in a blaze of glory. I like that because it kept me on edge because anyone could seemingly die at any given moment. 

IGN is not the only video game critic site out there that liked TLOU2. Metacritic is a collection of critics...their JOB is to review games and whatnot and validate those claims. I'm not saying it makes them infallible, but they support their opinions (good or bad) with notions that have merit. I'm not biased when it comes to IGN. For example, they gave Red Dead Redemption 2 a great score, but I have owned a copy for almost a year now and have yet to even open it. Why? I got it as a gift, but I'm afraid I will just get bored playing it. IGN's review of it mentions all the great details and things about the game that make it a great game, but I still don't know if I even want to play it. Another review was for Dying Light (the zombie game that came out a long time ago) and I HATED that game. I also didn't really give it much of a chance because I found it so frustrating to play. Apparently it is also a great game according to IGN, but they mention in the review that you have to work through it initially and to ""not be fooled"" by how it seems to play at the beginning. This makes me question my opinion on it because I gave up rather quickly. 

As far as the Angry Reviewer goes: yelling at your screen because you have to play as Abby and storming out of the room shows you are obviously biased and probably immature. I didn't want to play as Abby at first either, but I kept playing because the game was just really fun to play.  By the end, if you can't forgive Abby, it's not necessarily a flaw in the game, but your own personal flaws as a person. It's a fictional character...if you can't forgive a fictional character when the story gives you several redeemable moments with them,  then there's no hope for you in reality.

Also; if you preface your review with a ‚Äúbefore you call me misogynistic, homophobic/transphobic...‚Äù disclaimer then, yeahhhhh...you probably ARE. 

I appreciate that Naughty Dog took the risk to tell a story that they wanted to tell and they knew what they were doing with it. Everything was intentional in order to move things along and give the player the same experience of the first game. No one complains when they have you play as Ellie in the first game like, ""I don't want to be her! Where's Joel?!"" Every character is new until you spend time playing them. The whole point was to make the player reluctant to play as Abby...it was all intentional. You may not like it, but that's what they wanted, so I get it and it had the effect they were going for with me; I grew to like her and sympathize with her. People who don't get that and throw the controller down just because Abby lives are probably nasty, vindictive people in real life. The game asks you to embrace the idea of perspectives...but it's just a video game and it's fun to play the entire time other than the slower/cinematic character development parts. They give the player exactly what you want: a world of the same creatures, destroyed architecture, scary and intense creature fights, fun shootouts, stealth, and upgrades. There are plenty of things in movies and whatnot where you think a character wouldn't do or say something, but you don't label it as ""bad."" People like this guy are obviously not looking at the game itself and just focusing on aspects of the story that they have no control over.",2020-09-01T15:39:54Z,0,2

This is still a Joel and Ellie story. The character of Joel, yes he went off in a really cruel way, but it also shows the best parts of him even better than in the first game. The character of Ellie here is waaay better than in the first game. In the first game she's obnoxious and spoiled (for good reason), but now you have more context, and more layers to this character. The point of the game was not to take revenge. It isn't up to you to take revenge just like it wasn't up to you to spare the doctors in the hospital in the first one. The characters have enough agency to go beyond the control of the player. Ellie didn't kill Abby because Joel never wanted her to take that road. That's what she realized. That's why she saw Joel. What would happen if she killed Abby? Kill herself? Then now the whole game didn't even matter. What if she didn't kill herself? Then Joel wouldn't matter. The theme of the game was about the cycle of violence. The cycle stopped with Ellie. I agree that Abby takes to much screen and playtime, but I think that it was necessary to at least give her a little redeeming value after what she did. At least it's still a fair review, not like others who have given the game 0 lol",2020-08-31T17:19:29Z,0,0

The reason why you hated the game is because one of the main characters from TLoU1 was killed? [Yes, I watched the whole review] In fact I stopped mid-review and started to write this as I kept going...

People seem to forget Joel and Ellie are murderers as well, cold blooded at that, especially Joel. I know we care about them, but c'mon.
TLoU2 sort of immitates real life: People are flawed, they do fucked up things, they change and can be very evil given the circumstances. 
You might have not liked the story, but that doesn't mean it's not well told or written, 'cause it is.
I honestly didn't like Abby at all, and that's ok, you're not supposed to want to play as her... But I ended up liking her, not because I agreed with her actions, but because I understood we could be in a similar situation as her.
""B-but these are not the characters we love"" -Poeple grow up, they change...
""Why the sex scene?"" -Given the situation I think it's actually makes a lot of sense. 
""Characters are saved all the time"" Like in 80% of other games where characters get ""plot armor""? That's actually not a flaw inherent with this game.
""Flashbacks are too much"" -Not really, there are not that confusing.
""...What about the infection?... ""-The story was never about the infection. It is a character driven story.
-""We gave a 180 at the climax"" -I thought that was very intelligent; This is a story of vengance. Are we really expecting the clich√® of murdering someone at the end? I think what Ellie did there was the hardest thing she has done so far. That's not necessarily saying ""revenge is bad"". 
""I thought this was Ellie's story, like we were expecting"" -I don't know about that; I was expecting something different. Doing exactly the same things as the first game but with Ellie wouldn't have really inspired me.
""I'm not saying the story couldn't have played out this way"" -Yes, you are. Again, you might have not liked it, Joe, but that doesn't mean it's not narratively good.
""I guarantee they're gonna kill Ellie"" - That's possible... I don't really see a problem with it if the story is well told.
""Nothing shows Abby regrets what she dids"" - She is not really that good showing emotions. She shows regret and remorse by helping someone else she might have never do otherwise.
""...it doesn't make it good"" - That's a matter of opinion, I guess.
‚ÄúSo manipulative!‚Äù - Stories are manipulative. That‚Äôs how complex narrative works. 
-Ellie is not that of a good person...
-Ellie wasn't that much smarter in TloU 1. I don't understand why ppl make it sound as she was extremely useful in the first game.
I really don't understand why you ""can't let go of your expectations"" and open your mind a little bit to enjoy something Different.
Personally, and that's just my opinion of course, this game is a great sequel. It's a difficult game to play because of its heavy emotional driven narrative, but far superior to what they did in the first game.
Let's all agree to disagree I guess.",2020-08-29T18:58:13Z,3,1

I feel like it would ""subvert expectations"" to have us play as a young Abby, people thinking its a young Ellie but then they're like ""huh wait a minute"". And to the part that they get Tommy and Joel to the cabin, they should have killed Tommy and kidnapped Joel to take back to Seattle. So then Ellie is on a mission to save Joel, Joel some escapes the grasps of the ""Salt Lake City Crew"" because of the ongoing fight between WLF and Seraphites, Ellie runs into Abby and they form a kind relationship as they try to navigate the city to achieve a goal (but both being vague in what they're going for), a series of separation between the 3 characters (Ellie on her own and then with Abby and then Joel, etc.) before they get all three characters before the show down with Abby and Joel happens. And after, I really wish they showcased more locales, because it was an interesting point to see how other cities across the nation dealt with the infection. What factions grew out of the hysteria or corruption or necessity.

All the while, Ellie sees Joel seeking revenge for Tommy's life, she could see that he became the Joel that she no longer recognize and then she'd have to make a choice. She can then choose to follow Abby like she does in the current game but if she does give up, I'd say have her join with Abby in the quest for the fireflies and fulfill her need to be ""something"", be a cure or hope. It'd be a bitter sweet ending, where she's lost her father figure but doesn't want to end up like him but does want to do good, just as Abby wants to do good despite her revenge rampage.",2020-08-26T03:41:58Z,0,2

Hell, I even loved Riley and Bill, and not BECAUSE of their sexual orientation, but IN SPITE of it. I don't see Ellie as a lesbian character, but as a character THAT HAPPENS to be lesbian. Not the same thing. In Part II it feels forced into your face. Sexual orientation/gender identity is NOT the most important aspect of a person, as if that's what defines you as a person. You are simply the SUM of ALL attributes, whichever they may be. I disliked Dina because I found her boring and uninteresting, IF that was Riley instead, it would've been a waaaaay more fun dialogue, and even Ellie, she felt boring maybe because she had grown up and was going through the loss of Joel, but still, she felt boring regardless...and don't even get me started on Abby. 

The problem with Abby is not the fact that she is built like a tank. The problem is that ALL men in the game are muscular yet none of them look like The Rock or Schwarzenegger or Dave Bautista. If you make Abby look like a tank, then let me see some men in the game who look just as big as her. If the men in the game have good, but not exceptional musculature, then at least give Abby the Sarah Connor musculature and not make her look like Hulk Hogan...that would've been acceptable.",2020-08-24T04:26:57Z,0,1

And i actually quit some social media to not see any spoilers.

So I started the game spoiler free.
And apart from some game mechanics (smoke bombs... who uses them) that I thought are out of place.
I really only hated the stalker enemies.

I was angry at Abby first.... but i still rememberd what Joel did in the first game.

It is pretty hard to feel with Abby. When playing her I first thought ""I will jump of the cliff time and time.again to make her feel pain"". (Well her charakter model... taste differ lets say it like that).
But to make me feel with a charakter that I hated so much... it was a game changer for me.

I hated fighting against Elli as Abby. 
But I tried to see it as a movie, I mean modern games are movies but... like 20 times bether, and thus I noticed... man there is a story behind that.

So I played trough the part and was so happy that Abby let Dina live.
I also knew afterwards why Elli had to go again... (I hated it, but its part of the stroy). Abby had a cut... she let Elli live and thus was able to redeem herself.
But elli did not have that so she had to go.

When fighting again I was so happy Elli did not Kill Abby. 

The last part of the story then. The part where Elli learns that forgivnes (forgiving Joel for what he did) in an unperceft world... is the sword that divides the Tyran from the King.

It was just soo good to notice that Elli did all this... because she noticed in what situation joel was.

So I have to say... wohw.... woooohw. Good game.",2020-08-22T15:41:55Z,2,1

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-sTlYUeT8o,The Last of Us Part II - Angry Review,2020-07-02T02:32:07Z,@7cordrom378,"Before i start i'm going to say disagree with me if you want, but you better have solid evidence, or its just mindless bullshit.

Now. I've already made several lengthy replies responding to comments without Evidence. I'm here to defend a few major parts of this game because they aren't talked about enough in a different light. These parts include why Abby is just as good/bad as Ellie and Joel, Why Ellie sparing Abby isn't stupid, AND how Joel's death isn't cheap. I hope you will take what i say and make use of the evidence.

PART 1: Why Abby isn't really the villain.
When I first played through this game, I saw Joel die and i fucking HATED ABBY. I wanted to kill her so bad because she killed Joel, and this is exactly what ND wanted. And the switch to play with Abby for 10 hours I wasn't sure about. But i started to see something that most people didn't. What so many people say about abby is that they mindlessly hate her because she killed Joel. I'm sorry but you can't say that because theres no evidence. If you just don't like her character i won't argue with you but you can't just hate her because she killed Joel. What so many people don't consider is that Joel is also a VERY SHITTY PERSON. He executed countless fireflies and stopped the cure for mankind for his own selfish desires to have a ""daughter"" in Ellie. As much as it probably hurts to say this, Joel sort of deserved what happened to him. He had it coming. It's unfair to say that Abby is a evil person for killing Joel. In the TLOU2 world, there are no laws and if someone kills your dad you sure as hell aren't doing to feel sorry for them at the time. Abby is just another person trying to get by in a cruel, heartless world where people will do terrible things and if you want to go after them fine. I'm going to go as far as to say that Abby is just as bad as Joel and maybe Ellie, because they all do shitty things to help themselves in a world where not many people understand the concept of thinking of others.

PART 2: Why it makes sense that Ellie spares Abby at the end.
Ellie has come a long way from the day she met Joel. This obviously goes without saying. It's clearly understandable why Ellie want's revenge on Abby. But she gets to a point where she starts to see the result of her bloodthirsty actions. She see's mel's pregnant belly, and she is taken aback and what she has done. Ellie gets to a point here were she wants to leave, but obviously that is interrupted by Abby. Abby has every right to go after Ellie. After all, she came to Jackson to kill one person. and they left. Ellie comes to seattle and kills ALL OF ABBY'S FRIENDS AND FAMILY. Abby goes after ellie and eventually gets the upper hand in the fight. When she has a knife to dina's throat, she again has every right to slice dina's throat open. But Abby stops for 2 reasons, one of them seeing the role she is setting for Lev, and 2 she tried to break the cycle of revenge, by sparing ellie ONCE AGAIN. It's kind of funny how everyone says its stupid that Ellie spared Abby, but how not a single soul speaks out about the fact that Abby spared Ellie TWICE, and the second time she had every reason to kill both of them. A year later Abby has moved on and is looking for the fireflies, but gets captured. Ellie though, just can't seem to move on. Ellie is so hell bent on avenging Joel that she breaks her sanctuary with dina and potato just to go finish the job. In the end, Ellie lets Abby go. I think there are a couple reasons for this. 1, Ellie realized that she has to break the cycle of revenge again, because she started it back up by not letting Joel's death go. and 2, She realizes that killing Abby won't make her feel better and won't give her satisfaction. See the story of Wuthering Heights, in which Heathcliff does not find satisfaction in getting revenge on the person who wronged him, and instead lives the rest of his life in misery. They say that when you seek revenge, you dig 2 graves. One for your enemy and one for yourself. In short Ellie letting Abby go makes sense for her character, and is in a sense her finally letting it go and moving on.

PART 3: Why Joel's death makes sense and isn't cheap. (and in some ways deservable)
I'm going to restate a lot of points from Part 1. Joel isn't in any way a good person. He fucked up countless times and has essentially doomed mankind until another organisation (FEDRA or Rebels) happens upon another person who is immune and and tries to make a cure. This could take years, decades, or never even happen. Thinking in that sense, Joel has really fucked up big time. But joel fucked up more than just stopping the cure. He fucked up his relationship with Ellie by doing this, and in time he learns he fucked up in killing all of the fireflies. Jokes aside, Anyone could of gone after Joel, except Abby had the guts to do it first. What i'm trying to point out is that Joel doesn't get an honorable death because he isn't an honorable person. Don't get me wrong I love Joel as a character and i'm still disappointed that he died, but i'm not angry at Abby for her doing it. If you will put aside your anger for his death and actually take a look at the circumstances you might see that Joel deserved it as much as any other shitty guy. Now, i was one of the people who sympathized with Abby. You don't have to be one of those people but you should try to understand that she had perfectly reasonable reasons for doing what she did. She's not evil, she's just a human who wants revenge.

This is probably the longest comment i've ever written, so i'll leave you to read it and hopefully consider changing your opinions. I don't actually know how many people will see this but if you do i'd love to hear your response. Thank you for reading this.

Oh and to the people who hate this game because it features trans and lesbian characters, fuck you. go play something else.",2020-08-22T00:41:06Z,3,3

Or watching a couple of segments thinking they can critic the game accurately. I've just finished it and thought the game was great, highly disagree with this review, I'd definitely buy part 3. A lot of the people trashing the game are lieing(for example saying abby is transgender, just not true and there's no transgenders in the game, just to clarify.  Not that I'd even personally care) reviewers like angry Joe taking little things, like pacing (which is subjective to each player for starters) and ""no innovative gameplay"" way over the top and contradictory to other reviews done. Does anyone moan when the next first person shooter game comes out or, online generic area game...no. There's massive gameplay changes from part 1... as for the story the amount of trash films OJ and AJ rate, with AWFUL storylines honestly shouldn't be taken seriously.

People that are unable to see everything from another perspective, people that dont accept the fact that the ‚Äúbad guy‚Äù usually is not the bad guy, but just someone doing the right thing from his/her perspective. Usually, YOU can be the ‚Äúbad guy‚Äù without realizing, but by understanding the other side of the coin, you actually realize that most of the times, there is no ‚Äúgood or wrong‚Äù, just different lifes and motivations.
This game wanted us to understand everything from another perspective, and actually care for the antagonist, and i think they achived that 10/10, by making us realize there really isnt an antagonist. 
At the end, i know most of us, just like Ellie, were unsure about killing Abby, and even doe she didnt, and even doe she lost everything, is clear that Ellie finally found peace.

Also hated that you played as abby to fight ellie was stupid. I hated abby because her story devolved to go fight a cult, and it can be done right but not in a last of us game. The first one was a epic journey that joel and ellie take that gives us so many great story points. But here as abby, your just a ass. If the third is anything like this i predict that ellie is not going back to Jackson. Instead she travels and finds herself on a quest like in the first one, to travel somewhere in hopes to find a new home. Or shes gonna be discovered as immune and hunted for it. Theres gonna be a fake out where you thinks ellie dies but doesn't and ellie in the end, is left to make a similar decision to what joel did",2020-08-20T03:54:04Z,0,0

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-sTlYUeT8o,The Last of Us Part II - Angry Review,2020-07-02T02:32:07Z,@rocovailo2862,"Just wanna put in my two cents:
These aren't your characters.
People should not feel entitled like that (especially when it comes to fictional media). 
You like these characters, sure. They had a strong connection for you because how the story was told. (Joel is still, despite his fatherly tendencies, and incredibly malicious, selfish, hateful, deadly, murderous, and flawed character. He's NOT someone I would ever look up to in real life. I can empathize with him. He has... an okay attitude when he's not killing people. But as a metric for a real life person, there's little to no redeeming quality to him or his decision other than ""I am father, I will protect daughter at all cost"" which is... kinda fucked up actually. But the way they made that story, that's how you were manipulated to liking that character)

At the end of the day, it's my belief people should not connect themselves so tightly to characters as if they own them. As if there is some unseen oath that the creators have to do ""right"" by them. 
One of the biggest points of both games is sometimes people just die. There's no romantic end of life, there's no closer. Sometimes some girl in seattle offs your best friend and you'll never know who it was or why. Sometimes you do, and you don't get that closure, someone kills your dad right in front of you with no context leaving you with so much you wish you could have said or done.

Anyways, I understand that people want to have more... catharsis? Hell, one of my first reactions was ""Is this how it ends? But I want to know what happens... there's no neat little bow."" and it felt bad. But that's okay. I breathed, I thought about things and my experience through the game. Their story ended tragically, but tragedy is real to life and a good story element, I mean, look up Hamlet.  Some say it wasn't true to character, and I disagree. I can see why some would not like these characters going that way, but it all made sense. Joel softened up after 4 years of living in relative safety. Zombies weren't a problem much anymore, living was easier, didn't run into as much hateful people, surrounded by a loving community that obviously well appreciated him (I mean all those flowers!). 
You could see it every new flashback, he started to believe in people again. Heck their town would deal in trades with strangers. Yes, Joel of the last game would have been more cautious. But, combine his softening with the fact that they were fighting off a horde together, thinking the group was gonna murder him was NOT on his mind. You could see his hard shell return as soon as he was propt up onto the wall. His scowl, all of distrust and hate returned in that face alone. That's what I got. 

Ellie, sadly, was not going to be the savior of the world. She became a tragic character who let hate and revenge cloud her. Who couldn't let the only person she thought wouldn't die on her, who wouldn't leave her, die in front of her eyes, and the last thing interaction they had was just the barely beginnings of trying to make ammends to a relationship they had that was falling apart. She wanted closure, just like I wanted closure with this game between her and abby. But we didin't get it... at least not in the way we wanted. We got it in the form of just accepting that bad shit happens, and we have to move on. 

That's why I actually began to like Abby more than Ellie. At first, I hated it. I was NOT happy to play someone I thought was so vile... but I realize as I got to know her story, I saw that she, like Joel, like Ellie, were not perfect, but were far from evil. They had legitimate reasons for their misguided revenge. Abby got lucky, she got what she was after will little to no effort, running into Joel like that. Over time we see she becomes a better person. Realizes her mistakes. She lets Ellie go the first time because the shock of getting her revenge didn't help. She didn't want to kill more. The second time her want for revenge once again boiled when she realized her closest friends were murdered. She let Ellie go the second time because Lev pulled her out of her rage. He was her guiding light. Their relationship was cultured through Abby's want to fill that void of guilt. She was saved by people she was supposed to think inhuman. Over time, she got to know them and grow attached. Heck, she went through literal zombie hell to save the sister's arm. 

If anything, I think Abby is the one that went through the most positive character development, in that she learned from her mistakes faster and became a better person. She came to understand her mistakes, felt guilt and regret, tried to amend, felt more pain and loss, and chose, once again, not to kill. This proved to be her saving grace, as, despite Ellie wanting to still kill her, it's ellie who saves her (though also nearly kills her again... phew that was a rough fight. Couldn't even press the buttons half the time, hoping they'd just stop. Also, reminded me of those Kojima final fights where snake and ocelot dooked it out or Same Porter and Higgs had their fist fight... I think Ellie and Abby had the most powerful emotional fight. One where I literally just couldn't fight back half the time). 

This got more long winded than I originally planned. But I guess what I want to say is, I think they told a brilliant story. It made me feel a roller-coaster of emotions. Some that weren't pleasant. And... that's okay. That's art. Art isn't always supposed to ""feel good"". That's tragedy. But, there's still lessons to learn, there's still value, there's still some form of catharsis. I'm so glad those two characters lived and they can try to mend and improve their lives. 

Just... don't treat fictional characters and stories like they have to play a certain way. That you are owed to have these characters play out the way you think they should or a perceived ""makes sense"" and not even try to rationalize WHY they might have made such decisions. I understand people dislike it because they wanted a different outcome, because they loved what they got before. That's fine. But that's not what happened. It's more tragic. Last of Us 1 ended sadly, but Hopefully. Ellie lived, there's still hope for a cure (cus she's alive), Joel is alive, our main characters get to have their happy ending even if it means possibly dooming the human race. Last of US 2 ended tragically. Characters did not get out unscathed, they were left literally scarred. But, the two of them able to leave alive still has hope, that small light left. Abby and Lev still might find the Fireflies, Ellie still might be able to mend her life with Daina.  (also, small aside, as fucking evil as it was for Ellie to mass murder a bunch of Scars, Wolvs, and Rattlesnakes... she might have possibly made future lives in those areas better? At least when it comes to the Rattlesnakes especially, we weren't given much information on them but they keep people as slaves and prisoners, torture them, they seem to be sadistic gang members. She inadvertently let the resistant group go [who may be fireflies that were from that area?! ] and she ""saved"" abby and lev so... honestly her second shot at revenge probably came out way more positively in the end.)",2020-08-20T02:34:47Z,0,2

Now coming to the way he died and some other aspects of the story are supported by weak reasoning (not wrong reasoning).

The change in narrative theme from hope (1st game)  to hate and despair (now) goes against the previous fan-base and is directed towards a new audience, which isn't wrong, but then they shouldn't have baited the previous fans with the fake marketing of the game(suggesting the adventure of Joel and Ellie).

The MOST INFURIATING thing about this game is how easily Abby got her revenge, how the events conveniently placed Joel on the ""tee"" for her to take a swing. 

If the game was marketed as an anthology, and Abby actually put some effort in hunting Joel that would have been fine too.

This being a video game, no matter what story you tell it will again be another 20 hours of heavy handed violence. And after the anger fueled killing-spree of part 2, I can't imagine it being fun or engaging. Though if there is to be a 3rd and presumably final game, it has to be about the cure. There's no more room for overbearing hopelessness in this series.

But this ""review"" is increasingly difficult to watch. Chiefly because he has so clearly missed the entire point of the story. You aren't supposed to like Abby or grow to approve of her as a character, just the opposite. She is a morally reprehensible person and an irredeemable character, but guess what? So is literally everyone else in the game. *That* is the point. 

Abby's story is supposed to provide extra context for the complexities of her backstory and draw parallels to Ellie's, yes. But it is definitely not in the game to make you think she is a good person or to forgive her. The way that the plot is supposed to challenge the player is not by bringing them around to love Abby by the end, but to make them realize that Ellie, who we already know and love, has also, equally been tainted by the cycle of violence. 

You are supposed to eventually realize that both of the game's protagonists are driven to unjustifiably immoral decisions by their desire for revenge. More importantly, the journey breaks them both and destroys their relationships. Naughty Dog intended to tell a tragic story about characters that the audience knows do not deserve redemption but whose stories are compelling to us anyway. The character arc of a bad person struggling to do good even though their choices are morally grey at best is a trope we've seen countless times, from Max Payne to John Marston, and even Joel in Part I. 

This isn't *supposed* to be a happy story or even one with a satisfying ending. It's a bleak tragedy about survivors in a post apocalypse slowly losing their humanity and no one is unaffected by it, not even the characters that we like. I'll be the first to admit, that is a super dark theme to explore and a very risky way to challenge your audience. I certainly did not like the story, but I am also super impressed with how well it was done. 

Naughty Dog set out to tell a depressing, ugly narrative of gut wrenching, evocative character drama devoid of hope or peace or joy, and they succeeded. Masterfully. Is it as well done as the first game? Not quite. Did I enjoy playing it? Not nearly as much. Is it the best game of the year so far? Without a doubt. I get that tragedy is not for everyone. In fact, it's probably safe to assume that most people prefer to consume entertainment that inspires positive feelings, rather than the uncomfortable introspection that TLOU2 offered. But failing to recognize or acknowledge that the game is a tragedy and we are meant to learn that none of the characters in it deserve a good ending is Joe's biggest failure here.",2020-08-17T03:45:05Z,7,3

I remember getting into the first game. When it came out on PS3, I did not think it would appeal to me. A couple years passed, and I was at a friend‚Äôs place and he made me play the intro. It was the remastered version for PS4. I‚Äôm really glad he showed me the game. When Sarah died, I had to hold back tears. Not surprisingly, I got the game for myself and ended up beating it multiple times. Like for many people, the story really hit me the right way, especially Joel + Ellie‚Äôs bond. 

When I found out about the announcement for a second game, I was freaking out. I really wanted to see what was going to happen between Joel and Ellie. Would Joel tell the truth, or would Ellie find out? If Ellie learns the truth, will she forgive him? I just wanted to know what would happen in the story since the first game‚Äôs ending set things up so well for a sequel.

There was delay after delay for the release. I waited, and I waited, and I waited. There were also the many leaks and spoilers for the game (and many of them ended up being sadly accurate). I waited at least 5 years since I beat the first one (many people waited for 7). I gave it the benefit of the doubt. If the game is taking so long to develop (over 3 years after announcement), that means Naughty Dog is really taking their time to make sure it tops the first game, right?

Unfortunately, there is no smoke without fire. I start playing TLOU2, and I was pretty hyped at first since I loved the first couple of cutscenes with Joel telling Tommy what happened at the hospital and also telling Ellie he will teach her guitar. Things are going as I thought, right? BAM, 4 years later passes out of nowhere. I meet a ton of characters that I was not crazy about at first. But I wanted to give it a chance. The game was then making me play Abby, and then the whole scene with Joel‚Äôs death happens. 

After this scene, I wanted to stop playing. But I wanted to be fair, and it turns out that I was gonna play Ellie for a while. I actually liked some of Ellie‚Äôs missions, especially Seattle Day 1. But then the game makes you go back to playing Abby again, and then it turns out that it‚Äôs not just a temporary flashback. You replay ALL 3 DAYS of Seattle all over again, and all of your upgrades are completely reset. You can imagine my frustration. 

I was just so disappointed that what I thought the story was going to be only turned out to be a couple of flashbacks throughout the game. It was almost like two stories were trying to be told at once. The flashbacks and the main story did not fit together at all. The main story had very little to do with the first game.

This review (and the extended discussion) really hit the nail on the head. I was actually afraid to watch the review at first, because I thought Joe was going to give that game a 10/10 like many critics seem to have. But when Joe said, ‚ÄúYou done f***ed it up!‚Äù I was screaming ‚ÄúYes, he gets it!‚Äù in my head.  I am really glad that Joe was honest here, and I agreed with just about everything.

You are my go to for reviews and still are; you got this one wrong my friend. It is a masterpiece, full of raw emotion and a well written storyline. I found myself thirsty for vengeance, right along with Ellie. After playing as Abby, I found myself torn between the two. I experienced so much more emotion than the first one, and for so many more fantastic characters. The epic final battle, beyond the pillars, was the perfect conclusion. Tommy wasn't as thirsty for violence initially, because they killed Joel, not him. After Abby shot Tommy's face off, of course his response was going to be more intense. How do you of all people, miss that? Additionally, bro come on, although Joel was killed right away, he played a huge role to the story, throughout the entire game, even up to the scene before the final scene. We'll just have to agree to disagree. Take care of yourself and keep up the great work. You are appreciated!",2020-08-16T02:22:06Z,0,1

Think. For. Yourself. I would admire Joe more if he did NOT give an arbitrary score that means nothing at the end of these videos, that's just me though, I'm a nobody. But I guess that's too much to ask anymore, and a large part of why society, especially in America, is going to shit (NOT because of Joe, just trying to be as transparent and even as I can, though no doubt someone WILL inevitably take this out of context). No one expresses their own thoughts or ideas on anything, only what they have been TAUGHT to believe. If they do have them, they just keep their heads down and sense it's not worth speaking out. How about if every gaming franchise you ever loved adopted Social Justice norms, would you speak out then? Or would you actually have the guts to preempt a cataclysm, and call the bullshit artists out. Just a thought.

They must first embrace a school of thought, and branch out while dejecting all opinions that don't align with their own. Then they must actively portray any and all thoughts outside of their own as bunk and repreeeeeeeeeeehensible. The final stage is to indoctrinate everyone to their own beliefs, problem is they A) have no idea what their own beliefs are and 2) have just been sucker-punched by the big tech they are fighting against.

We have to be spoon-fed a feelgood story about Joel and Ellie going on another adventure through the country. Screw paying attention to new characters or feeling empathy for them. Backstory is just them forcing it down our throats! Joel didn't deserve to go out this way, there's definitely no precedent to set up his brutal death. We wanted more Ellie and Joel and nothing else, there's no way that past events can have consequences! The conclusion makes no sense because we didn't pay attention during the story because we were too mad to care!

How do you people come to these opinions? I'm so disappointed in you Joe.

Edit: After playing the game a second time, watching Joe's extended discussion and some other reviews, I've come to the conclusion that TLOU 2 isn't as perfect as I originally viewed it as. It definitely has some flaws and taking the gamble of playing half of the game as Abby was an unnecessary risk the devs took, considering how much they put into developing Joel and Ellie in the first game.  I still think the story has many amazing moments that make the game good, but I'm just here to correct my rather outraged comment. Ironically just like the game isn't black and white, neither are the opinions people have of this game. I don't think calling it ""a petty revenge story with shitty unlikable characters told in a jumbled mess without the connection that the first one had"" is fair, but I can look past that and agree with many of the points people have of why TLOU 2 isn't as good as the journalists say it is.",2020-08-14T00:21:49Z,20,6

After a while you just have to try to get a tourniquet on it.‚Äù ‚ÄîNo Country For Old Men

Never has a quote been more relevant than with The Last of Us 2, Where two women violently grope and slash into the void, without realizing how loose their own tourniquets are, without realizing how much they‚Äôre bleeding out, bleeding out of loved ones, bleeding out their souls, bleeding out‚Äîin a very literal sense‚Äîof their entire lives. This is a story about the art of letting go.

We‚Äôve all heard the Spanish proverb that revenge is a dish best served cold, and we usually interpret this to mean that you‚Äôre more likely to get away with it with some substantial distance between you and the original act, or perhaps the person you seek to pay back will have their guard down after a long enough interval, but I believe the original author also meant that, if you wait long enough, you probably won‚Äôt seek revenge at all, which will save you from, not least of all, the damage you‚Äôll end up doing to yourself.

Consider the following:

After their final brawl on the beach, when Ellie let‚Äôs Abby up from the water and tells her to ‚ÄúGo‚Äù, then follows that with, ‚ÄúJust take him,‚Äù she is NOT talking about Lev.

FLIP

There are two sides to every story, and It is appropriate that Abby‚Äôs collectibles are coins, because this story has metaphorical coins spread throughout the game. one example is that Abby is the flip side of Ellie. Even their names are similar: A-BB-Y ‚Ä¶ E-LL-IE, children of a murdered father, children of stolen childhoods, children who must learn together that digging for revenge leaves the hole within themselves, and the thing you think you‚Äôll find at the bottom of all that digging is never enough to fill the hole it took to get there. The only thing at the bottom of that well is more falling.

FLIP

Joel told Ellie that if he had it to do over again, he‚Äôd make the same choice to stop her fatal operation, but this, too, is a lie, because it mistakes his very nature, that he never had a choice at all. His daughter was taken from him by men in uniform during the outbreak, and although he did everything he could to keep Ellie at a distance all throughout that first game, she got to him. Shortly after that, men in uniform came to take Ellie as well, and that was something that Joel was incapable of allowing.

Ellie needs to understand this, but she‚Äôs too caught up in her own need for her life to have meaning or some kind of fulfillment. Here, too, is another found coin for us to turn over and examine, because (if you‚Äôll recall) we as the player of Joel at the end of The Last of Us, are also victimized in this way, since we are forced to kill Abby‚Äôs father in that operating room. We have no choice; the game will let us spare everyone in that room, but Abby‚Äôs father will not let us pass (let‚Äôs play videos abound on YouTube of players attempting to get Ellie out of that room without killing anyone, but the developers make us kill Abby‚Äôs father).

FLIP

There are hundreds, possibly thousands of little coins for us to collect (I could fill a book with them), but here are a few:

Tommy shoots Manny in the head, Abby shoots Jessie in the head.
Joel kills Abby‚Äôs father, Abby kills Ellie‚Äôs father
Tommy is reluctant to pursue Joel‚Äôs killers, Tommy is hell-bent on it.
Ellie stabs a pregnant Mel in the throat, Abby cuts Dina‚Äôs thr‚Äî
Wait‚Ä¶

This is where the cycle is broken. It is in this moment‚Äîwith the knife to Dina‚Äôs throat‚Äîthat Abby truly begins to let go. Indeed, it is appropriate that Lev and Yara are called ‚Äúscars‚Äù, because, like scars, what they give Abby is the capacity to heal. And this is one of the things that Joe gets wrong, when he says Abby never shows remorse. We see it in her face the very moment after she kills Joel. She thought it would ward off her demons, but she realizes that it was a mistake to believe that.

Ellie isn‚Äôt so lucky. She is tormented beyond that time, because she is struggling with the art of letting go. If Ellie had not visited Joel on his porch just before his death, she almost certainly would have finished Abby off on the beach, but the flickering image of Joel sitting on his porch was Ellie‚Äôs moment. By confronting Joel and admitting her willingness to taking the path to forgiving him, she is able to begin to let Joel go, which means she is now able to let Abby go as well, hoping that by doing so (‚ÄúJust take him‚Äù) Abby will take that part of Joel with her (the part of her relationship to Joel still tormenting her).

This game is a flawed masterpiece, but the flaw isn‚Äôt in the story. It‚Äôs flaws reside mostly in the fractured, meandering way that the story is told. It is nested with the sin of a wilderness of flashbacks (at least one is a flashback within a flashback!) It is a game for which opinions and the final analysis, like revenge, are best served cold, lest we become tormented by how we perceive the way we were wronged.",2020-08-13T02:42:50Z,2,5

The story is what got me and what will get most people. I can get over the fact that Joel gets killed. I like him a lot, but it is a game set in a post apocalyptic world overrun with zombies and savages so w/e. I can‚Äôt get over the fact of HOW he got killed and HOW they introduced this Abby chick. Like Joel gets killed by some random buff trans chick, and then I‚Äôm forced to play as her for half the game?? What??! That‚Äôs not how you introduce a new character. Abby would be more likable if her character‚Äôs background and story had some substance but it severely lacks it. Overall, I give the game about a 7 (maybe a little lower). I‚Äôm not gonna act like I HATED the game, but it just didn‚Äôt feel as exciting as the first one for the reasons I stated above. Not to mention you don‚Äôt even kill Abby.

I went out of my way to avoid the spoilers and earlier leaks so I could try and enjoy it with an open mind. There was definitely some 'woke' moments that felt forced or shoehorned against the wider narrative or tone. It's still a really fun game from a gameplay perspective, the graphics, voice acting and mechanics are all typically high quality.

But the story definitely is polarising. I ended up not minding Abby and Lev BUT Joel did deserve a better story than what he got. Same with Ellie. 2 of the best video game characters in recent years were not given proper justice. Also, I really hated Dina. Easily my least favourite character in the game. I would gladly have seen her die instead of Joel, Jesse or basically anyone else tbh. I feel like they should have given Abby/Wolves/Scars storyline a standalone game/DLC and kept the TLOU 2 on Joel and Ellie.",2020-08-12T00:00:49Z,0,3

You are free to dislike Abby and her crew and that portion of the game, but you shouldn't overlook the crucial and exciting moments due to that. For example, the scars and the attack on their village. And I get it. Some people wanted an Ellie game (me being one of them).

I don't think the story was paced well at all, with a lot of long sections and flashbacks that should've been at some other point in the game. The other thing is that Ellie and Abby's stories don't clash together at all and I felt like I was playing 2 different games. I also think they should have put the flashbacks at the beginning so that we not only get the context to why Abby kills Joel and give us some time to spend time with Ellie and Joel before he dies. I keep seeing people saying that Joel shouldn't have died and that Ellie should have killed Abby, but I feel like that is the stuff that I like, as Joel's death is what starts the plot and Ellie not killing Abby as showing forgiveness, which is the real theme of the game. But I totally understand not liking this game, I just think that people were arguing about the wrong problems when there are other ones that are way worse. I feel like a big part in that is when people criticize the game, they didn't play it and didn't get the full picture and are just looking at certain plot points out of context.

From nonstop retarded story points and SJW crap, not to mention a holocaust reminder in year 35 of a zombie apocalypse and a girl that looks like a man to the disregard of what the first game was good at.  The reason it was good was because you could empathize with Joel cause he was a normal dad and he lost his daughter.  That whole element is thrown out the window with the jewish girl who dumps the Asian dude while she's pregnant to become a mentally unstable person.  The best line in this game was when Ellie said to the baby ""We are gonna have some stories to tell you when you're old enough"".  My first thought was that kid going ""Where's dad?"".  This game from a play-ability aspect is horrible as it literally changed nothing from the first game.  It's really a masterpiece of subversive propaganda though with all the trans signaling and the references to events that have no relevance to the story and pushing the destruction of nuclear family.

The entire dynamic around Joel, Ellie, Abby, and the Fireflies is why telling Abby‚Äôs story was almost a necessity. Especially considering how the game ends and OBVIOUSLY sets us up for TLOU3. Abby joins the Fireflies and searches for Ellie to finally develop that cure. Ellie gets the redemption she needs, not by killing Joel‚Äôs killer, but finding her true purpose in life. I think once TLOU3 comes out and it‚Äôs all said and done TLOU2 will be looked back on more fondly then it is now.",2020-08-10T10:04:13Z,2,0

I had a blast and I loved the original. Story was actually damn good in my opinion. Yes, the flashbacks get annoying, but how else can you get emotionally invested. Plus.. I really thought abbys gameplay style was freakin dope. When I figured out how to actually work the momentum skill (and not in the spammy way these guys do it for the video), I was not sneaking for shit anymore cuz that skill was stupid strong and fun. You can rush people down in such a fun way.

As for the story.. its much better than this video gives it credit for. If you take the time to really get to know abby and pay attention to her story, its an interesting perspective. I was so invested that I was biting my nails in the end. From a literary standpoint it was awesome too. The themes, the dialogue. Loved it. When you choose the path of revenge, you are bound to lose a piece of yourself. To those who played the game know what I'm talking about.

I really dont get the hate on this game and on abby. Quite honestly, people be hating on her body type cuz shes not a typical female video game protagonist. This is what good story telling is about. Ellie started off mentally tougher than anyone imaginable.. and by the end her struggle with ptsd showed the fragility in her mind. Abby was physically gifted but was just a bag of bones at the end.. Ellie was driven to revenge by Joel's death... but choose to let go of hate, out of Joel's memory... cmon folks.. Yes its not perfect.. I would have loved to play with Joel again... but... I don't know... keep an open mind. This game is dope and I hope the next one is just with abby and lev.There i said it. PLEASE DONT DOX ME lol",2020-08-09T11:41:25Z,1,2

Don't get me wrong there's lots wrong with this game and it pales in comparison to the first, but seeing people shitting on it from an emotional standpoint just kinda solidifies the themes and exactly what naughty dog was going for‚Ä¶

p.s. if you finished the first game still 100% liking Joel I think you kinda missed the point a bit, he kills hundreds of people and even Ellie is unsure about him at the end‚Ä¶ sure we still love them both and feel like we'd do the same, but your view of him is skewed a lot more by the end‚Ä¶ idk just my thoughts",2020-08-09T03:48:35Z,0,1

every human on the planed should be forced to play this game
every fkn polititian in the world
every fkn game reviewer and censorship expert
every child under 14
every fkn human and animal 

next GOP summit or UN sumit or WHO sumit or every fkn summit conference gathering sunday church mass etc EVERYONE SHOULD BE LOCKED IN LAST OF US 2 ISOLATION and forced to finish this game of life.

than - if they are not crying and realising how stupid and pety and insegnificant and pointless all their world views and ideological political racial virus etc view and opinions are 
they should all be packed up into Musks Steel rockets and balsted into space onto new planet to start their fked up constantly at war selfopinienated civilisation.

I HATED THE FKN GAME 
I HATED PLAYING AS DUMB ARSE KID ALLY not giving JOEL a MAN chance and hating all the men in her life
I HATED PLAYING AS SHITHEDED MONSTER ABBY the muscle woman - i think woman not sure
I HATED ALL THE GORE AND UNECESARY VIOLENCE - (turns out it is necesary

AND THAN I RELAISED WHAT ND is doing - they are teaching praying hoping people will get the fkn message
that when put to test we are all the same animals and violence hate misunderstanding and lack of the villingnes to listen to the OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN 
leads to distruction
as it has since the begining of the civilisation

this game is bigger than anything out there currently
even though same fkn messagese are in all fkn movies and books -- its just that well they are hidden

HERE FOR THE 1ST time its all out in the open
it makes you on purpos hate HATE HATE the game HATE THE CHARACTERS, HATE YOURSELF FOR PLAYING it

ON FKN PURPOSE as in the end well half way through it expolains very clearly what its all bpout
WHAT IS THE HUM<AN CONDITIONING 
WHAT IS BLINDSIDED BELIEF
WHAT IS REVENGE
WHAT IS OUR INABILITY TO SEE THAT WE ARE FKN SAME
and that our salvation is not in FAITH CHURCH BOOKS HISTORY AI QUANTUM MECHANICS NEURAL NETWORKS
its in 
children
and mothers
and fathers
and family
but family that cares not ajust about their blood 
but about every living thing equaly

thats why ELLY vs ABBY (4 letter words) (one dinosaur museum scene - dinosaurs extinct species) (other sea world - that we are fuking up right now and turning into extinction)
both of them have no no children but both have friend that does still in their womb
that they kill

there are so many subtle and not so subtle hints philosophical mesages and age old questions in this game
in Horizon zero dawn
in death stranding
all same
all with same answer

but hey lets argue now about is it better on PS4 or Xbox and should ND make pt3

Yeah its unfair that Joel died this early, yeah its unfair that Ellie doesnt get her revenge like Abby did, but so is life. We suffer in this game, because it's NOT the mediocre revenge-is-bad-story, we FEEL the pain and the senslessness of our actions and thats the thing which makes this game so amazing. I dont know what the people wanted, a Joel-Farming-in-Jackson Simulator or the exact same journey like last time, just with other cities and other fractions? Of course Joel deserves better, of course Ellie deserves better, but that terrible things happened to them, doesnt mean the writers hate them. You're all too spoiled by Disney movies, which just please their viewers without challenging them. Telling the same boring story with lazy writing over and over. Those are heartless products, neither movies/videogames nor art. Maybe if Ellie just travel back in time together with Nathan Drake and Crash Bandicoot to kill Abby with the infinity gauntlet, you all would think this is masterpiece. (I mean seriously Avengers Infinity War, this piece of garbage got a 9/10) I know this comparison is kinda bad and I also have my issues with some aspects of the game, but in the end it was a great experience.",2020-08-06T21:15:07Z,2,2

Usually when I finish a game, I feel very exhilarated and feel like I accomplished something. By the end of Last of Us 2, I actually felt terrible. I felt like a masochist sitting through that entire thing. 
It wasn't that I found the game bad. To be honest, I actually found the game to be a very good game in its own right. I just spent most of the last part of the game screaming at the screen ""just stop already!"". The game had so many points were I thought we had finally had some closure but then Ellie just keeps going. Towards the end, I was actually routing for Abby because Ellie was just so fixated and I honestly saw the only way it would end. Also, add to that the fact that Abby seemed to be growing as a person along the way whereas Ellie seemed stagnant. 
What made this story not very satisfying is comparing it to Last of Us 1. The thing that made Ellie such a lovable character was her resilience and cheerful attitude, both of which are missing from most LOU2 even before Joel dies.

I‚Äôm not going to call anyone that gives it a negative rating or disagree with me homophobic. I am disappointed in Angry Joe‚Äôs review and rating. I just finished the game spending a good 30 hours on it and I have to say I don‚Äôt see the problems Joe puts their. This isn‚Äôt fallout happy and fun sunshine, this is an end of the world story that is miserable and people fighting to survive. The first last of us when Joel kills the Doctor this cause a negative reaction of Abby to hunt Joel down. Once Joel is killed Ellie hunts down Abby, it‚Äôs a beautiful revenge story that shows how far revenge can consume you. Playing from another perspective that‚Äôs a great idea see their side and possibly change on their journey. I know it‚Äôs just my opinion but I had fun with this game, moments of being scared and dread, fun game play, story paces all right I give this game a 10/10.",2020-08-06T02:46:40Z,2,1

Yes I loved the 1st game as well... but you'd had to be a fool to think Part II would be about Joel & Elle again... what did you want to see? Them extending their relationship?  Sorry Joel was a dick & he lied to her. I would have done the same thing if I was in his shoes... which makes me a dick as well. But the point is, that's what made the 1st game so compelling. 
Part II, dives into it more... to say that Part II didn't have that... is just flat out crazy... 
Joel wasn't a hero... neither is Elle... or Abby or anyone in this fuckin world.
It's not Naughty Dog fault you built up Joel & put his ass on a silver platter.
When you do dirt...you get dirt. Joel admitted this numerous times to Elle on the 1st game... stating he's not a good guy. 
& even on Part II... knowing how much wrong he's done... he looked her in her eyes & said ""I would do it all again"" ... that was so powerful!

That line made me ok with what happen to him in the game. People act like they killed Peter Parker. He was Joel... a lying, selfish, piece of shit... who I loved. 
But it's an zombie apocalypse... people die...& death comes cheap. 
What all these girly ass Joel fans wanted legit death for Joel? On his knees, facing his murder, looking dead in his eyes...
Who's doing that shit in real life? Let alone a zombie apocalypse?!?! 

Man...get over yourself. Find your balls & attach them back to your sack.

This game was amazing & surpassed the 1st game in every shape & gaming structure imaginable!

Glad that someone other than my self said it. Open the game playing as abby. Have all the events that you play in abby's story happen before, and lead up to Jole's death. Maybe playing as Jole for the breif moment when he saves abby. If you do that, make it a power fantasy. Jole is an experienced killer, make the player feel that in game play. Then upon Jole's death Switch to Ellie. Play up until the scene where She finally catches up with Abby, Have the loss happen in a cutscene. After the loss, you can then have all the Ellie and Jole flashback game play. Giving the impression that the flash back is happening in real time while she heals up from the ass kicking that she just had. Then you can have the final segment of the game take place as it did, with one change. Put Abby's life in the player's hands. Almost as to pose the question to the player, do you agree with our message. At that point the player will have played through the cycle of vengance, have had a chance to empathise with Abby before wanting to kill her, and the game's message will have been delivered. All that will be left is to decide weather or not the player still feels justified in ending Abby's life.

Joel had it coming one way or another, he wasn‚Äôt a very good person fuck even taught me realize that after the opening scene, he actually said in the middle of town were literally anyone could hear in that 

This game made me hate Tommy, The only two characters I liked at all on Ellie side were Dina and Jesse

Abby‚Äôs character was very distant, especially after Joel killed her father but oddly enough if you set aside your hate for her which apparently you did not, you probably would‚Äôve noticed that her story is metaphorically a mirror image of Joel‚Äôs in the first game

The gameplay is amazing I would imagine if you had to steamroll this game as a reviewer it would get a bit repetitive and fatiguing with the searching and the stealth but as someone who took about 2 weeks to beat it i found it engaging super dark and thrilling, the graphics best out there barring pc of course. The sound glitched here and there but very rarely, i found one immersion breaking  glitch in the hospital when abby phased through a counter to open a box. The story the characters were beautifully fleashed out ruthless yet endearing and memorable, on the other hand i feel decisions were made by some characters that really didn't represent who you actually were.

Yeah Druckmann went with the ""look how fukked up the world is after this pandemic, everyone is so wacked out"" approach.  The wackiness kind of made the characters more interesting though. But I do agree that in part 3 they should get the story back on track just to make you feel like you're trying to accomplish something other than just searching for scraps and fighting for territory and revenge.  Do a part 3 with the main focus on how its still possible to create a vaccine so it feels like there's more of a purpose other than surviving amongst a bunch of human wackos and zombie-like things with the world being completely stuck like that.",2020-08-04T06:01:29Z,0,0

He'd see they were making Abby jump off of cliffs and ledges and when you got the Ellie fight, they let Ellie get her revenge on Abby. After seeing that, Neil Druckmann gets butt hurt and decides to patch the game that way players won't be able to jump off of cliffs and ledges and make Abby commit Suicide. He'd add invisible walls, and on The Ellie fight, you'll forced to use stealth otherwise if you get spotted be Ellie, Abby doesn't die. But instead it's game over. Then Neil has a message for Players who tried to get Abby killed and it mocks those who didn't like Abby. It'll say something along the lines of just because you're playing as someone you don't give a shit about doesn't mean they need to die. So from this point, your save game file will be erased. I wouldn't put it past Neil Druckmann to do that in The last of Us part 2. But it might make him change his mind. There's actually a potetion to remake The last of Us part 2 story and pretend The last of Us part 2 we got isn't Canon. Honestly, There's alot I do like about the story we got. Even in dare I say it Abby's story. There were a ton of Neat ideas. They weren't excuted in a perfect way. But I have a feeling it has something to do with Joel barely being in it. I'm sure Neil Druckmann will release DLC where you play as Joel and it'll be a form of Carthus if you really didn't like The main story in Last of Us part 2. He'll probably release it six months later after the game came out and will remaster it on PS5 with all The DLC and extra difficulty mode and multiplayer. He did the same thing with the first last of Us game. It got DLC released in 2014 and He remastered it for PS4 with all The DLC and it costs 50 bucks at the time. But I think that will happen with this. Maybe people will be a little more forgiving of it. Maybe they'll wait until prices drop. Either way, Things through time have a way for healing in good or bad ways. The Star Wars prequels. Even though I still have issues with them, time has validated them and the hatred has deminished over the years because of how not so great the Disney sequel trilogy is. Am I saying time will validate the Disney sequel trilogy? Of course not. Maybe they're be great years later or Maybe we won't forgive as easily.

They are both HURT AND DESTROYED by the circumstances which leads them to do unthinkable deeds such as killing. Ellie managed to do something that Joel did not when he handed Ellie over to the fireflies... and that was to be selfless empathetic and most importantly to see the bigger picture which is one of the things lacking in the world of last of us.. That's why abbie got  another chance to live. Just a greatly made game with perfect ending.

*GAME DIRECTOR AMY HENNIGS IDEA OF HOW TO TELL A STORY*

early Joel: loses his daughter and tries not to get attached to a daughter figure all throughout their journey

ALSO Joel near the end: falls in love with ellie like a father and daughter type of way and chooses to save said daughter figure over saving humanity

early Ellie: tries to act brave and funny and has an affinity for puns while also being cute and adorable

ALSO Ellie near the end: isint afraid to be and act vulnerable and learns to grow up and survive thanks to Joel

TLoU2 characters personalities and progression:

*GAME DIRECTOR NEIL DRUCKMANNS IDEA OF HOW TO TELL A STORY*

early Abby: spends four years holding a grudge and trying to hunt down and kill a random old man who only wanted to protect his daughter figure first meets him by getting saved by said person then begins to torture and kill him in front of his family

ALSO Abby near the end: randomly decides to save her enemies for saving her despite their hesitation to do so and unease around eachother and let the grudges shes had for them for the last few years go

early Ellie: cant accept bigot sandwiches and treats some random old guy as unforgivable trash and an absolute murderous piece of unlikable shit

ALSO Ellie near the end: is 100% ok with letting the murderer to her father figure go for no reason and ditches everything said father figure ever did to help her survive

*FINAL RESULTS*

*AMY: good story telling and character development*

*NEIL: fuck men and fuck ellie abbys the perfect role model for women everywhere*",2020-08-02T03:33:08Z,54,16

So if you, in any point of the game, had the urge to forgive or understand ""Abby's feelings or reasons"" you must be prepared to be also forgiving with ANY unknown son of Osama bin Laden, Saddam Hussein or Muammar Gaddafi who managed to invade the house of a former US president and BRUTALLY kill him with a golf club, baseball bat or a Hockey Stick in the living hall.
They have their reasons at last...
The only thing I don't like in the first game became the center of the second, the fail scientific argument that the fireflies scientists  MUST kill Ellie in order to cure mankind. What hell they must to do replicate her immunity that is mandatory to KILL her, there is not much sense, medic sense. 
AND Ellie is the ONLY immune supposedly and if Abby's daddy screwed the procedure (in any way)  he had kill BOTH Ellie and the hope of the cure. NO SECOND CHANCE. 
So the premise of the game about Abby is fundamentally WRONG, because her daddy was a Josef Mengele and/or a absolutely faulty scientist. A fraud...
And her daughter became a crazy, pumped bitch...

To understand the games goal:  creating two characters which we are supposed to hate and love at the same time, there is empathy needed. And the ability not to judge and hate too quickly. Many people obviously weren't quite able to do that. ""I came here to play Ellie not 10 hours of Abby"" is a perfect quote as an example. People that say that typically didn't even give Abby or the game a chance to get to know her because they were way too attached to the characters in the first part. Which would normally be a good thing because in the beginning we were supposed to hate Abby but not later in the game. And if you still say kill Abby after you finished the story, you absolutely didn't understand the message of the game and probably chose to actively keep hating Abby without giving her a chance. I am not saying that you have to love Abby, but simply hating her because she killed Joel, ignoring that she had even a bigger reason to get revenge than Ellie, is ignorant in many ways. Yes the game has many flaws and plot holes but it is not garbage just because you decided to hate a character from the start until end without even trying to symphazise with said character. If Abby would have been the focus in the first part and we would have had a story with her, everyone would want Ellie dead for killing Owen etc. It would then be ""I came here to play Abby not 10 hours of Ellie"" A portraied situation like this depends on the given perspektive. People that say ""oh no hopefully they don't make a sequel of the 2 part in which they critizise killing npcs"" also totally didn't understand what the game is trying to say and probably had the words  ""hate Abby""  set in stone from the start of the game. If you aren't able to symphazise with a new addition to something just because you love the old and known too much don't blame it on the game and call it garbage because you are too limited to grasp the concept of the game. That is the actual reason why the game is rated so bad by the community.",2020-07-31T19:48:41Z,6,1

I think they simply moved back to Jackson before the last scene.  I don't think she lost Dina or the child at all. Before Ellie goes to track down Abbie for the last time, she leaves  the bracelet behind.  (She's not wearing it at all during the final missions.) 

Yet when she returns to the farm in the final scene, EVERYONE failed to notice that she is not carrying any of her weapons and she's WEARING the bracelet that we saw her leave BEHIND!  She's already been there, she's just collecting a few things! 

Additionally, she doesn't call out to anyone in the house. She's not expecting anyone to be there. Nor does she seem surprised about it at all. 

This to me, supports the argument that she's simply ended the cycle of vengeance and can finally continue a healthy life back in Jackson, which is where we see her heading in the last shot.",2020-07-31T15:43:59Z,0,0

I'd like to mention None of the characters are poorly written or shitty (Your words) and its a perfect parallel between the two stories as they become one in time and space. At least you noticed the animations, the graphics... DE DETAIL! 
Show us new features you say: You can crawl now! Then around 41 mins you start crawling in front of an AI and another one that is already shooting you, you run to the corner, but forgot to use crawl to get under the cargo... Wow! There were tones of hidden places where you could only get in crawling or crouching.
What these new features for if you are a barbarian and wont use them? I disagree, I think the game has innovations and it also stayed loyal in design like menu or weapon menu to the first part.  ""And the bolt action rifle"" is one of the strongest weapon ingame - especially if you know how to use the scope... About Abby's arms functions as health indicators? Not on any challenging difficulty level... Where even the first two zombies would challenge anybody.
You also forgot to talk about the combat system at all... I mean, the game has one of the best close and - range combat system mixed with stealth out there atm and I would like to emphasize here there are core differences between fighting with Ellie or Abby. They put so much effort in this game... 
I was close to rage at the end I know this was the way for Ellie to grow and improve as a character but I totally agree they should give us choices, like kill Abby and/or Lev, or Let them go, Let only one go... I would be a great start of a new chapter. 
Still everything else in place in this game... Which you didn't talk about... Its smooth, great controls, details of environment are exceptional, face expressions, physics, AI - was the best AI I met in games so far. I met only one texture bug during my whole game play, which is top category.
You know It also gives a great extra to this game when you play it on a harder level because then you slow down, supplies and tactics will became challenging, so you'll notice so much more than what is visible around you... 
DEATH! There are so many ways to die! Its so fucking detailed when you get ripped into half by a zombie, never got bored on the screen.
Btw I just loved how the cinematics were made as it goes from cinematics to gameplay ""vica versa"", its so fluent... I felt like Im watching my own movie! I was always interested ""wtf will happen around the next corner"" and it kept me like this till endgame. Still can't compare to any game, apart from its story and character's choices its far the best game out there you can purchase.
 I hope it will win the Game of The Year title.",2020-07-31T15:39:23Z,0,0

Do I think this game is a overall story masterpiece, no. Do I think this game is terrible because a lot expectations were defied, absolutely not. I think this game had an intention in mind and it was to be completely different than the first one. The game makes you feel numb, disoriented, wasted, broken, and emotional in the end. I do agree that these factors as well as the overall story could have been executed better, however, this is what we got. Honestly, Joel's death did not bother me as much as everyone else. I expected 
his death was bound to be brutal because of what he did in the first game. It could of been handled better but for the purpose of this specific story, it made sense on a broader scale.  There's a lot you could nit pick and complain, and those opinions aren't wrong, but why waste so much of your energy
hating every little thing this game offered? With everything that has happened in this year so far, I'm just grateful I finally was able to play it. Naughty dog was just trying something new and so what if it was only okay. The actors and creators certainly don't need death threats because of it. I know this comment doesn't really amount to anything but it just makes me so irritated how jaded and negative gamers are right now. Find the positives and move on.",2020-07-31T07:51:29Z,1,2

I bet that have it no been for the spoilers you would have enjoyed this game a lot more, and that can happen to any game or any other type of story.

Saying a narrative is manipulative to get you to like a character is literally describing what a narrative is and how it is supposed to work.

Did I enjoyed seen my favorite characters get crushed? Fuck no

Do I think the Joel / Ellie narrative could have been the only thing to drive the narrative of this game? No, I don't want to see a great story be turned to pieces just like every other sequel.

I think that ending Joel and Ellie's narrative and giving another brand new set of eyes to this world was adequate and a bold way to ensure that this game does not become an unnecessary franchise.

If Abby was added in a stand-alone sequel she would've been just as hated, if not more hated, than she currently is.

Anyways just sharing my thoughts, asides from that great video as always.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-sTlYUeT8o,The Last of Us Part II - Angry Review,2020-07-02T02:32:07Z,@jaron788,"The only issues I had with this game is:
1. How Joel was treated. I appreciate the detailing mid-game with the flashbacks and everything, I even cried just going through his house AFTER he was killed, but not during the death scene. It made me wonder, but i realized it was because they treated his death so casually. I believe it would‚Äôve been a lot better if they didn‚Äôt give out the information like dumbasses. Maybe Joel wouldn‚Äôt have, but just because Tommy did it ruined it. They would‚Äôve never done that in the first game and shouldn‚Äôt have here. Going through his home and finding the picture of his Sarah, Sarah‚Äôs watch, etc. was way more emotional.
2. The second half was WAY too long. I agree they did want us to care about Abby and show backstory somehow instead of just having small talk and plot holes, but having 2 hour long flashbacks, way too long cutscenes that mean nothing in the long run, a unnecessary sex scene, etc. 
3. How people don‚Äôt like the ending. I actually love the ending, but because I hated it. Let me explain. I‚Äôve realized the developers WANTED us to hate the ending, because even Ellie hated how it all ended. I‚Äôm tired of people always wanting sunshine and rainbows for every game ending, because it‚Äôs not always a happy ending. I think it went over most if not everyones head. The only part I believe this ending is bad for is it‚Äôs possibly a bridge into the next game, which is cheap, but it‚Äôs hard to tell. 
4. The FLASHBACKS! I get it, we need plot, we need backstory, etc. but having flashbacks in the middle of some of the most conflicted moments in the game takes so much away, and to be honest makes me forget how amazing some scenes are. 
5. The repetitiveness of the Abbys play-through (the second half of the game). Do I even need to explain? It‚Äôs understandable that she‚Äôs different from Ellie, and we need to adjust to that, but if you play like the first game taught you how to play or just how Ellie is, Abby is completely different. Ellie is a risk taker, loving, happy person overall. Abby just makes me feel like I‚Äôm playing as a overly-masculine woman who doesn‚Äôt understand how the world works until the plot needs her to. 
6. The WLF‚Äôs entire foundation. We are just expected to believe somewhere like Seattle is a warzone between people? Key word: PEOPLE. The Scars do seem like post-apocalyptic people, but to have a war between a group who literally defeated the MILITARY can‚Äôt kill some bow-and-arrow-shooting forest people is just dumb, as shown in the ending, they could‚Äôve easily ended the Scars, so the fact a war between them had been going on for years is just stupid. 
7. The forced love. Okay, I‚Äôm fine with Ellie being gay, I‚Äôm fine with her being in love, I‚Äôm fine with Dina risking her life for Ellie and Vice-versa, but they also just act like they don‚Äôt have lives themselves. For Ellie, saving Dina may be good but it‚Äôs risking her mission to kill Abby and the WLF‚Äôs is stupid because it makes her act conflicted when there‚Äôs no reason to be. Either go to Seattle and risk your lives to end Abbys, or don‚Äôt go at all. Trying to save Dina from predicaments she put herself in is just stupid. 
8. The confusing timeline. It‚Äôs just going back and forth and back and forth and even as Joe said ‚Äúit‚Äôs flashbacks in flashbacks in a flashback‚Äù. The repetition is too much already, but to have the huge timeline crisis is terrible. 
9. No giraffes.
10. The saves just to add more to the game. ‚ÄúOh if it‚Äôs not the end of the game, Ellie shouldn‚Äôt kill Abby yet. If it‚Äôs not the end of the game, Abby shouldn‚Äôt kill Ellie yet.‚Äù
11. The pregnancy crisis. Either PREGNANT WOMEN MEAN SOMETHING OR THEYRE JUST EXPENDABLE LIVES! I‚Äôm supposed to believe just because Mel got knocked up I (as Ellie) should care more and not have killed her, ohhh but Dina is pregnant too. Not to mention we don‚Äôt know how many pregnant people we‚Äôve killed already in the series, and we‚Äôre supposed to care now?
12. Seattle. The beginning with the almost free-roam like setting was AMAZING. But to only have it at the start then make the game linear again is confusing to me. I loved being able to go to the bank, then to a random store, then resume story areas. 
13. Making us want to care about Abbys backstory. Okay so I‚Äôm supposed to like some random girl whose father I killed? Abby is the only one now, the only person whose ever cared about Joel killing them, and no other NPC has ever wanted to go after Joel afterwords. 
14. The focus on SCARs. It‚Äôs already too much to focus on Abby, Ellie, their backstories, WLF‚Äôs, Infected, Seattle, Dina, etc etc. and to add SCARs makes it too much. 
15. No giraffes again. 
16. I might be alone here, but the little use of dogs. I hated killing dogs, it was sad when Boomer went RIP, but to only have a total of what, 7 dogs? They made so much detail to them. Names, flanking, smells, etc etc. and they just don‚Äôt even use them 95% of the game.
17. No jump scares really. I wouldn‚Äôt classify this as a horror game, but the first game had a lot of surprising, ‚Äúscary‚Äù moments. Like the bloaters first appearance, etc. 
18. The little use of infected. They added ONE infected (rat king explained in 19) the Shamblers. They aren‚Äôt as hard to kill as bloaters, but not as easy as clickers. Bloaters were these huge boss-like infected that weren‚Äôt used much because of the rarity of them, but shamblers are everywhere but still not hard to kill at all.
19. The RatKing. This BADASS infected has to be the coolest thing in the game in my opinion. But to have 0 backstory unless you read every note in the building and look up videos or articles on its story, it‚Äôs saddening. 
20. Dina.... Dina is supposed to be Ellie‚Äôs everything and Ellie is Dinas everything, but what‚Äôs her story? Does she have family? If so, were they in Jackson? Are they somewhere else? Did they support her going to Seattle, or not know? Did she even care about her future after leaving the home at the end, because I don‚Äôt understand it. If there are answers to this let me know because I don‚Äôt get it. And she seems like a hoe after hearing she‚Äôs pregnant then gets with Ellie soon after.  

There are a few more but nothing out of just subjective opinions. I expected so much better after a 11/10 game with part 1. This game is rate is a solid 7.3/10. The graphics, emotions felt and solid theme is good, but the plot holes and repetitive playing is too much, and I mean WAY too much. Thank you for reading this far if you‚Äôve made it here, and if you have any questions comments or answers to my list please let me know",2020-07-30T08:08:30Z,1,5

If she was just the bad guy and you took out all of her gameplay and her sidekick the narrative flow would make a lot more sense. It would only take minor tweaks to get there from where the game switches over and not many to tidy up the ending either. I think her gameplay section was added to make the game longer since this type of game has less replay value than multiplayer competitors.

I've been watching this show for going on 7 or 8 years now and typically I do agree with Joe on a lot of things, not everything mind you but this. Joe went too far in his parody's in this, like way too far in his parody's. The beginning one was good and the ""this is my brother joel miller"" one was really funny too but then it took a turn from poking fun to out right attacking especially with the last one. Now me personally I did enjoy the story, it left me unsatisfied but in a good way. This review felt more like he was comparing it too his own personal expectations instead of allowing the game to stand on it's own as a sequel to the previous game.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-sTlYUeT8o,The Last of Us Part II - Angry Review,2020-07-02T02:32:07Z,@TheRighteousFist,"I have to say that this is one of the few reviews from AJ that I wholeheartedly disagree with, but I won't waste my time trying to justify the game. Personally I thought it was incredible. Just finished my second play through before watching this video, and for me it lands solidly in my top ten games of all time.

I think the main problem Joe has is that he wants his heroes to win too much. His love of the first game made him put Ellie and Joel on a pedestal, and he couldn't get past his biases to see that in the world of The Last Of Us, there are no heroes, just regular people on different sides of a bloody, violent conflict, whom all have their reasons for getting involved. The protagonist of your story isn't always a hero, and in reference to that, Tess tells Joel in the first game, ""Guess what? We're shitty people Joel.""

Joel did something that ultimately came back to haunt him, and set off a series of events that costs too many people their lives. All of this was referenced in the first game. There was a part in the first game where Ellie gives Joel the photo of himself and Sarah that she stole from Tommy, and Joel says, ""No matter how hard we try, we can't escape our past.""

Also, I believe Joel's death was perfectly done, in that it happened suddenly and crassly. From the sound of it, Joe wanted Joel to have a ""heroe's end"", and was expecting Joel's death to be more - significant? Impactful? But I have news for you. Death isn't always some glorious ceremony, especially in the world of The Last Of Us. Joel is ripped away from the audience, suddenly and brutally, and his death leaves a gaping hole that you feel in your chest, exactly the way it does when someone is taken from you like that in real life. It's not fair, it doesn't make sense, it's just something ugly that happens and there's nothing you can do about it, and you're forced to wrestle with it. With as much grief as Joel's death ultimately gave Joe, with him experiencing the seven stages of grief in this video, progressing from anger to denial to bargaining to acceptance, I'd say the writers did their job without Joe even realizing it.

Anyways, I thought the game was epic, and everything that happened between Abby and Ellie made perfect sense. Angry, hurt people hurt those around them, and leave chaos and destruction in their wakes. Violence has a ripple effect, and I think that was the overall message. In the end, I believe Ellie came to accept that Joel had earned his death for killing the Fireflies, that Abby had suffered enough, and the cycle of violence needed to end. There was no reason left to keep killing, so she just . . . stopped. I loved it, and I can't even imagine where they will take the story from here. Most likely a new story with completely new characters in a completely different plot, and that would be great. Ellie deserves to be at peace.",2020-07-29T16:44:01Z,1,2

Pure chance lead to Joels death. Just like many chances lead to other people‚Äôs deaths.¬†

 And I for one congratulate naughty dog, for being mature. And making arguably the bleakest most depressing game ever made.¬†

Don‚Äôt like it? Don‚Äôt play it. It‚Äôs made for grown ups who understand the real world and how ugly it can be.

Even after Joel's death Tommy warns Ellie of hunters on the way to seek revenge on Joel's death, but was not a bit suspicious of a larger group armed survivors. And from the first game we see how larger groups of survivors tended to kill lone survivors for their belongings, a note that Joel finds in Henry's office besides the hunters, bandits and the cannibals. Neil with the developers chose a story that completely went against the first game. Around Tommy's residence, should one have seen any of the bandits who ravaged there from the first game? And the main plot was disaster. The fireflies collapsed with Marlene's death after Joel's big raid in the hospital when he rescued Ellie.

People cannot just enjoy the game for what it is and appreciate what they were trying to do with the story.  To me this was a perfect game.  Joel died that sucks but it showed in the end Ellie was able to forgive (both Abby and Joel) which was extremely powerful.  Forgiveness is powerful message that more people need to incorporate in their lives in a time where everyone wants to cancel each other and social media is full of hate.

When these writers go woke they want to have strong female characters, but they don't know how to magnify the power and abilities women do have so they make them quasi-males. Make sure their breasts are small, to counter all the oppression of comic book characters!

Finished it, sat down, thought for three days, checked a few impressions on youtube and found a whole other side to this game that not everyone will appreciate. Neil Druckmann has a tendency to leave things to open interpretations, which hurt this game the most. We were never meant to empathize with Abby. This isn't her story, it's Ellie's. And the moment you realize it, the whole story changes for you. Abby was just the tool that Ellie needed to break. It took me time to realize that while TLoU was all about the bond between Ellie and Joel, it was all about Ellie really. You just witness the story from someone else's perspective. Same thing in TLoU 2. That scene? It wanted us to hate Abby. The gameplay segments? It wanted us to understand Abby's perspective, not care for her. And all of this was apparent only during those last 10 minutes of the game. Ellie loved Joel, and his death gave reason for her to understand him, and to forgive him.

Took me time to get here, but I appreciate the risk ND took. Not everyone will appreciate it, but it's storytelling at it's  best.",2020-07-27T10:37:11Z,2,4

Maybe because I‚Äôm new to the series I have a different view but I didn‚Äôt have any issues with the storyline at all.  It was a truely beautiful game, the best graphics I have ever seen in a game and the story was phenomenal!  There are always 2 sides to every story and both Ellie and Abbey had really compelling narratives and good and bad traits.  2 sides of the same coin.

In the first game I didn‚Äôt want to kill the surgeon, I thought Joel was being somewhat selfish.  A cure could have saved the human race, how many other children have died from bites and spores?  And the fact that he lied to Ellie proves this, Ellie would have given her life to get that cure but he didn‚Äôt even give her the choice.

Ellie had good cause to hunt Abbey for killing Joel in that way, but then you‚Äôd have to agree that Abbey had good cause to hunt the man who killed her hero, last brain surgeon, father and destroyed the cure for humanity!

The gameplay was great, combat is difficult and interesting, there are lots of puzzles to work out, there are diverse geographics, and I can‚Äôt remember the last time a game has made me so stressed and nervous while moving around infected areas.

Deserves its 10/10 in my opinion.  People don‚Äôt realise how good they have it, when I was young we had Chuckie Egg, Manic Miner and Chequered Flag on 4bit systems.  I‚Äôd even quite like Abbey to be the protagonist in the next game, she was tough, interesting and was actually morally better than Ellie, who was quite willing to leave Joel‚Äôs brother to die to get her revenge.  Which is something Joel would not have wanted.  He wanted her to live and find happiness.",2020-07-26T11:25:57Z,0,0

All of that I understand now, those are choices by the story teller.
But what pisses me off is the choice by the story teller to show what fucking angel Abby is....a fuckin beacon of goodness and make us try to feel bad about Ellie...Ellie kills dogs...Abby loves dogs...Ellie kills pregnant woman....Ellie only thinks about revenge....I mean come on! You made us fall in love with Ellie and Joel as characters, fine bad things happen to them, but atleast don't make us feel bad about them and make us feel good about the one who brutalized them.

Nobody can say that doesn't matter or it wouldn't fix it. This is a worthless video now because Joe knew too much going on and that affected his view.

If it was called ‚Äúwalking dead Seattle‚Äù it could have just been a 9/10 game. Unfortunately it is TLOU2 and needs to be held to a higher standard. They did not deliver on plot / characters and our beloved duo basically both die with no conclusion at all whether positive or negative. We all know revenge and anger is bad.

That's ok for a while but you can't make an entire freaking game based on just those negative emotions. Even if it is well written it will resonate negatively with a lot of people, and while half of the surviving characters get some ""redemption"" the story just doesn't do them justice and in the end you just feel sad and empty, the complete opposite of the first one ending. Sure enough it has some good moments and it's true that it didn't play safe just to store some quick cash, but there's nothing to cover its flaws and even worse you are attacked for pointing them out.

The whole point of the game seems to have been missed in this review.

The whole point of the dogs wasn't to show Ellie as an evil character, but a survivor.  Other characters didnt have to.

So here is from the halfpoint of your video forward. 
.
1. I've never seen a grown man react like that to a sex scene. You say it's out of nowhere? Nope, it's been setup for the last like 8h of the game. She killed JOEL!!! if you still scream that by the moment the sex scene happens, I don't know what to tell you it's just bad faith at this point. Abby proved many many times that she is not a bad character in context of this world and you should be able to appreciate her consuming the love she has had for this character since the very first scene you see her. Also not react like a 8 years old, you're just proving the sjw feminist right that gamers are basement dwelling childs. which we are not. 
.
2.The flashback in flashback in flashback : You are just lying.. I mean there is no way around it. There is flashbacks, very clearly specified and chaptered, and then there is the Abby story which can't be called a flashback it's basically 50% of the game. Also you make it sound soooo complicated and nonsensical, I hope you are hamming it up for your audience.
.
3.The plot armor problem : you are reaching now. But at least you are not wrong, it is a problem in pretty much any narrative driven game, you know, like The last of us 1, I'm sure you didn't make an obnoxious little montage for the first game did you?
.
4.Subvert all expectations is bad : Yes, I agree. But, I expected Joel to die quickly in this story, his arc was done in the first one it wouldn't make sense to continue playing as him on a narrative perspective. I expected Ellie would not just go kill Abby and then the game would end, that's just not the style of Naughty Dog to make such a cut and dry story. Again, you might not like the way things go but it doesn't make it bad. When I was nearing Abby with Ellie on the third day in Seattle, I didn't know what to expect which was the moment where they needed to subvert expectations, and they did in a way NO OTHER VG EVER DID. But god forbid someone call it bold... 
.
5. ''I didn't want to care about those new characters, I care about Joel, Ellie'': Yep, thats pretty much your WHOLE review, all the rest is just lies or stupidity. 
.
6. Joel saved Ellie to prevent the firefly from having too much power : No. He did because he became so selfishly enamored with his new ''daughter'' figure that he couldn't bear losing her. You don't even understand the first game which you say you loved much more...
.
7. The story is about violence being bad : Wrong again, it's about hate and the things you do for hate, Neil Druckmann said exactly that years before the game was even released. It's also about grief and the cycle of violence. There is no good or bad in The Last of Us, only the viewer interpretation of the morality presented. For instance I never thought Abby was unjustified, even before I played as her in the second part of the game. Think about it, when she asks Joel why he thinks he's being killed, he can't even TRY to guess, that's how many people he murdered. I think overall the story is A LOT MORE about characters than themes, but you seem to only concentrate on themes.
.
8. Owen is a piece of shit because he's a cheater : Grow up you child, people do bad things sometimes, Owen is also a great guy in many, many ways. He even loved Abby before he ever loved Mel.
.
9. Mel was on the frontline pregnant and it's stupid : 1.They were not going on the frontline, they were doing a routinely peaceful mission. 2.They were at peace with the scars at the beginning of the 3 days in seattle. That attack on their truck was probably the first attack in a while. 3.They make a point of explaining why Owen wants Mel to be there, he is a good guy and he wants to end a quarrel between his lover and his best friend (once again setting up the upcoming sex scene that you thought was out of nowhere HOURS before it happens). 4. On a narrative point of view, if Mel was not in that scene, she wouldn't have had much screentime at all and it would have been much harder to care for her character later when she insults Abby. (which btw is a GREAT dialogue scene that shows how much the game is NOT about good or evil)
.
10. I don't care about the new characters!!!!!!! : Allriiiiight we get it! goddamn it's really your only fuckin point. 
.
11. The 3 days as Abby are the same as the 3 days with Ellie : Yes, except no environments are the same, your enemies and weapons are different and they introduced new mechanics. But yes its the same 3 days so its the same thing. Can you imagine how tempting and easy it would have been for naughty dogs to re-use environment of the first part in the second part?! They didn't do it even once and for that they really deserve better than you goofballs shitting all over it.
.
12.  I thought it was Ellie's game : really? even though you were spoiled before you even began? So you knew all that was going to happen but you went into it with the idea that it was Ellie's game. ok. I wonder if you went in the game without knowing every beats beforehand... would it be more effective? mmmmmmmmmmmh let's think about it. MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMH.
.
13. The Ellie and Abby get together and team up argument : it's so clich√©... do they fight Thanos together at the end? 
.
14. Nothing says that Abby regrets what she did : Not explicitely but implicitely throughout the whole game. Also, why should she regret or be sorry for killing the man who killed her father again? It's not as if Abby came and massacred Jacksonville, she let everybody live BUT the guy who did the deed. Once again if you look at the game in a morally black and white way like you do, of course none of this makes sense.
.
15. The story could have been done with those beats, but not that way : Ohh, i'm sorry, how did you want to story to be written Joe? It's really dumb that they didn't consult you for their story isn't it.. Clearly you are a better writer THAN THE GUY WHO WROTE THE LAST OF US. Kill Bill could have been good too if the story was in chronological order right? 
.
16. The story would be better if we played Abby first : That is such a weird thing to say... The game would HAVE to be completely different, with different dialogues and hints and foreshadows and setup. You spent your whole review saying you dont care about Abby and then you say you would have like to play as her as a child and to see her muscles grow? gtfo you don't even know what you wanted, you just think it's fun to shit on hundreds of thousands of hours of hard work by people with actual talent. 
.
17. Revenge is good for Abby but not for Ellie : Hahahahaah oooooh Joe, ooooooooh boy. So sorry you didn't understand anything. I would love to see you react to a movie like no country for old men, how confused would you be. 
.
18.  Don't play this, it's a waste of your time : As an extremely big fan of the last of us 1 and now of 2, fuck you Joe
.
19. The AI companion are stupid : Go look in the option dumdum.
.
20. Teaching kids that drugs are good : wow. good lord this review is garbage.
.
21. You have prone now : What? thats all youre going to say about one of the most instrumental addition to the gameplay? What about the dodge which makes the melee combat 200% more fun than in the first game? oh, not mentionned. Ok. 
.
22. Ellie don't pick up ennemy weapon and just take bolt action bullets of of a machine gun: that literally never happens in the game. 
.
23.The critics will tell you you don't understand : yes.
.
24. Just because it's explained doesn't make it good: You're right, but it does make it sensical. It's not because you don't like it it's bad. 
.
25. 6/10 review : A 6/10 is a mediocre, middle of the road game. If you think that's what it is i certainly hope you give Ghost of Tsushima a 3/10 you hack.

Also I think people should stop with the ''I waited for 7 years to play as those character again'' ; 
.
1. No you didn't, most people after the first one didn't even think their would be a sequel because they thought the story had a perfect end. 
.
2. The first game had a perfect end because Joel has completed his arc as a character. 
.
3. Ellie was not a playable character in most of the first one so where is this big attachment for playing as Ellie anyways? Also she was a kid in the first one, this is 4 years later and her world was shattered by the realization of what Joel did, it's not far fetched to write her differently than in the first game at all.. 
.
4.Joel death wasn't foreshadowed or setup... well i beg to differ, as soon as you play Abby for the first time it's pretty clear what she is up to, you just don't know why (Owen says something along the line of  : ''He's living here''.. who did you think they were talking about?)Also the fact that Joel says his name willy nilly is not exactly correct, Tommy tells his name and Joel's when they first meet Abby (who immediately reacts to it if you watch her facial animation, so they were already doomed, because of Tommy). And again when they are with the WLF it's Tommy who says his name first and Joel follows up with his. Also after all the bloodshed caused by Joel in the first game, don't you think it's normal that he would now try to be a better man and save people he can saves? They were also in a resident evil 1 situation where they had to run to safety so yes, there are MANY setups and foreshadows for Joel's death. The fact that he is the one saving Abby is called tragic irony, not bad writing. 
.
5.Abby is badly introduced and doesn't have enough backstory... she has more than Ellie AND Joel combined, her whole arc is FILLED with information from her past and present. Even her muscles are explained by the fact that A. the WLF have tamed animals for eating and B. When you see Abby's room it's filled with exercise equipment. 
.
6. Abby's story should have been a DLC : oh yeah people would have been super psyched to have to pay twice for a complete story, gamers are always happy when that happens. 
.
7. I didn't wait 7 years and a half to play as Abby : How full of yourself are you? it's not your story, it's the story of the people who did that other story you love so much, and they clearly understands their characters and world a whole lot more than you three silly gooses. If you waited 7 and a half year to replay Last of Us 1 and your whole review is basically ''it's not what I expected'' then you need to consider that what you expected was the most lazy thing they could have done. Instead of rethreading, they cover new grounds, maybe you don't like it but it doesn't make it bad you child. Also when the fuck did Joel become such a mascot, you play as him in ONE GAME. People talk about it as if it was mario getting killed and then you play as bowser for the rest of the game it's so goddamn stupid.
.
8. They do emotionally manipulative things to make you like Abby : you couldn't even begin to explain yourself on this one, the whole goal of media is to manipulate emotions. Don't dare telling me the first game didn't do the same, they made you love Joel for the whole game only to reveal him as somewhat of an evil character at the end. And I say ''somewhat'' only because you are in HIS shoes, for everybody else involved, Joel is a random maniac who came one day and murdered a bunch of people, disbanding one of the only good clan in this universe, including the only surgeon capable of maybe finding a cure....
.
9. Ellie loses everything while Abby wins at everything : Ellie lost Joel, Jessee and two fingers and maybe Dina but I don't think it's an unsolvable dispute at all at the end. Abby lost all her friends, her father, her love interest, her dog, she's tortured for months and then slashed and drowned almost to death by Ellie. But, it is true that they present her as a good character, because SHE IS GOOD. People see her as evil for one reason and one only, the killing of Joel. Otherwise she is a much better person than Ellie or Joel and that's the point. Abby is like a version of Ellie where she actually manifested her desire for revenge, which made her realize that all she did before was influenced by her hatred. Now that this hatred doesn,t exist anymore she tries to get out of the wlf before the big fight while saving people from an enemy faction just to prove to herself that the realization she made after killing Joel was the right one. Also weapon wise, to answer your stupid little skit, Ellie gets a knife, joel's gun, a better shotgun and landmines, please stop lying about this game you hack. 
.
In conclusion, I would say the fact you were spoiled before the game came out is a huuuuuuuuuge disadvantage for naughty dog. All the elements of emotional surprises were cut down... You basically went into the game with expectations you were not supposed to have, which imo makes this review garbage. Also a 10/10 never have and never will mean that a game is perfect, it means that the things it does are so uniquely well done that playing other games after it is sort of a downgrade. For instance i'm playing ghost of Tsushima right now, a very beautiful game in its own right... and boy, in comparison the animations are stiff and broken, the glitches and bugs are everywhere, the story is so plain and unsurprising that I skip most dialogues and the transitions put you out of the game immediately, in other words, a good old 8.5/10. Naughty Dog is being judged on a wholly different level than any other companies and that should give you a hint of why this game is, in fact, a masterpiece. Much like Hereditary was lambasted by half the viewers and then became recognized as one of the best horror films of all time, TLOU2 will be remembered as the swan song of this generation and a new stepping stone in naughty dog's long history of immaculate storytelling.",2020-07-23T17:35:42Z,14,0

Joe's reaction to Joel's death is exactly how Naughty Dog wanted you to react...they literally wanted you to hate the fact that you have to play as Abby lol (they literally tested the game and got that exact reaction which is what they sought out, no surprise there)
Waited 7 years not to play as Abby, so what exactly were you doing in those 7 years?!?! how were you waiting to play as Ellie and Joel, did you mark it on your calendar and replay TLOU 1 over and over again? Ellie found out Joel lied about her saving the world? They should be different characters because they are dealing with those issues...
It's pretty funny that all your reactions are exactly what they wanted for the game, except for eventually liking and understanding Abby's side of it lol (BTW, Abby didnt get molotovs, ellie got a submachine gun and a sniper rifle)
The whole SAVED counter? cmon Joe you can literally do that in any game FF7 remake, RDR 2, GOW...please, how many bosses did CLOUD not kill in the remake? they literally always survived
Innovation? How bout playing a character trying to kill a main character, which game has given you the ability to shoot at a main character (Abby shooting and trying to kill Ellie was awesome, i died on purpose just to say Ellie was a formidable foe)
You want this game to have a pretty bow and fit, life isn't like that, you could be minding your own business and then some dumb woman can falsely accuse you of sexual misconduct, People change and relationships end and people are flawed...Abby showed remorse by sparing Ellie TWICE, if anything ELLIE should have shown remorse by being spared twice and getting to be with DINA and become a parent and she left all that to go get ABBY who let her live (that bothered me)
I really don't understand how anyone can give this game below a passing grade (7/10), I am very very surprised at this score and several other people hating this game.  I understand the hate but that still doesnt merit giving this game a failing grade, there is no way.
Why do we need justice for Joel's death? thats the whole point of the game, shit doesnt make sense, life isnt fair, things dont happen the way we want, shit impacts our life and totally changes us, this whole Covid has changed my perspective and im a different person",2020-07-23T15:36:09Z,0,0

But I played to the end never feeling bored. I also liked the Character of Abby and didn't have a problem with the way she looked.  Why wouldn't a battle hardened female soldier bulk up her physic? Was interesting to see the point of view of a character you were instantly made to hate by the shocking beginning.

Whereas Ellie had to battle her demons related to her fall out with Joel, and when she snapped after Joel's death, she couldn't let it go ultimately leaving everything she had. Only when she remembered the conversation she had with Joel about wanting to try make things better that she snapped out of it. Neither of them are bad people, but it seemed to be all about them overcoming their wrongful agenda of revenge. As all it did was cause more chaos with their friends getting hurt in the process.

They get into a big fight, and Ellie leaves as both a way of disconnecting from her emotional dependency on Joel, and to try to find the fireflies and work towards the cure (now that she is actually mature enough to understand that sacrifice), and throw in the whole ""it would've made my life mean something"" for deeper affect. We can introduce Abby as a mystery character, and establish that she is also looking for the fireflies, but why we do not know. Later we find out she lost her father and had a very strong relationship with him, and her father-daughter relationship will work as a foil to Ellie's. We play as Ellie finding clues to the fireflies, and she tracks them down and confronts them, but they turn out to be a corrupt perversion of the group seeking power and control, and attempt to use Ellie for themselves. All the while, Joel is going after her, and we play him for a bit with those nice flashbacks of him and Ellie, but not too much. He catches up with Ellie and hears her in trouble, and together, with Abby who has also found the ""fireflies"", the trio destroy the compound of corruption and make their getaway. Shortly after, Ellie expresses her regret in abandoning him, and accepts him as her father figure and all is right again. An easve-dropping Abby hears who Joel is, and at the right opportunity murders him brutally, starting our revenge plot with strong antagonist who we will not relate with. Ellie swears revenge, and Abby rubs it in by saying something like ""I guess you can understand my pain"" but like more epic. Ellie breaks free of her binds and attacks Abby, but is not physically strong enough to defeat her, and they are seperated by a hoard. Abby goes on to build the old fireflies and educate herself in her fathers profession, so that she can honor his ambitions and find the cure. We might play as Abby for like 30 minutes, but only to have her recieve punishment from the universe and establish that she is actually a trash person. Ellie tracks her down, in the 2nd half of the game, and the final battle between the two is epic and conclusive as Abby fights the continue her fathers legacy and attempt the creation of a cure, while Ellie fights for the retribution of her father, Joel.

I actually do a lot of creative writing on the side, so let me know what you think of this plotline! I'd like to become professional one day :)",2020-07-23T02:38:50Z,0,7

I think the last of us part 2 was very well written . I sometimes play a story for example god of war it‚Äôs not my type of game. that does not mean it‚Äôs a bad story. that‚Äôs why the critics and YouTube reviews are so far apart. because they take there own opinion which is not pure. because they don‚Äôt look to the quality of the story just there own opinion.,2020-07-22T09:14:59Z,0,2

It‚Äôs a challenging story that departs extremely from the first. I thought it was good mostly. The fans of the first game don‚Äôt own the story, characters or anything. Naughty Dog did what they wanted and obviously made a lot of fans mad. The expectation of this game tainted it. There worse games with better reputations because the characters weren‚Äôt so important to the fans. I think that is the power of both games. The backlash is deserved if the fans really feel that way, but it seems like hyperbole sometimes. Did you really play through the whole game and hated it the whole time? Cmon, it‚Äôs a solid 7-8 without your love of Joel. If anyone plays this game before the first, would they hate it as much?",2020-07-22T07:26:01Z,0,2

She nurses it to health, raises it, begins to heal from the unquestioning companionship of a loyal animal. We get to see them save each others lives again and again, we play a mission where Ellie is frantically following the sounds of her dog whimpering through the forest, knowing the dog is hurt and being persued a race against time to save the only thing that she has left in this miserable world. We succeed and after some respite, we move on together, the dog still limping slightly from its wounds but clearly regaining its health. That's the first half of the game.

Second half begins abbie is pinned down and forced to watch her dog being drowned in a perspex tub so she can see its pleading and panicked eyed as it thrashes and struggles for air.

Spoilers: I hated the idea of killing off John Connor but at least that made more sense to do that considering he was the leader of the resistance. Joel was a leader of nothing. As I said in this game his role was his daughter Sara in this game. It didn't have to be. But if they really wanted Joe to die, it should have been setup much better than it was. And then have to play as his murderer....what? That really took the wind out of my sails.

Life isn't perfect and more than often things don't leave up to our expectations. Joel made a decision based on his personal beliefs that humanity as he knew were done for good and doesn't have be fixed on the cost of Elly's life.

Accept it the entire duality of the story went over your head fat boy. These characters don't exist for you and that upsets you, spoiler alert coooonsumer they're trying to tell a thought provoking story about characters in a fictional dystopia and yet you are worried with how a character dies? Looks like you've missed the train on this one. Just admit it you devalue ellies story and progession because shes female, for example you argue that the ending has no point yet in the first one it ends almost identically with literally nothing being solved except its deep character development, you're so focused on the plot of the 2nd one being unresolved yet the last of us part 1 ended in a worse plot position than the 2nd. The plot of the last of us IS it's characters, and if you didnt feel Ellie's evolution as a character I'm sorry you're to bigoted to even witness it. Drop your expectations, take your childhood out of these arguments; our childhoods in our own eyes is simply too harsh of a critic.",2020-07-20T19:18:20Z,0,1

The game doesn‚Äôt have to give you what you want to be good. Also Joel‚Äôs relationship with Ellie is still explored and compounded on during the course the game via the flashbacks and Ellie‚Äôs introspection so I don‚Äôt agree that Joel‚Äôs death is rushed.

The story also belongs to Abby, Joel‚Äôs killer. But how could they make us play as the villain? Because Naughty Dog is teaching us to take a walk in the other‚Äôs shoes. They want us to understand that there is a side to every story. Let‚Äôs think hypothetically here for a moment: it‚Äôs 2013 and The Last Of Us has just been released on the PlayStation 3 and we play as a doctor trying his best to keep his daughter, Abby, alive during an apocalypse, all the while searching for a cure to save mankind. 

You eventually discover an immune girl who serves as your best shot to rid the infection. Just as you‚Äôre about to proceed with the operation, a hatred-fuelled maniac, the immune girl‚Äôs father, breaks into your settlement and guns down everyone in sight, including you, the doctor. You then play as the daughter, Abby, as she discovers her murdered father. She has suffered a great loss. Abby then vows to exact revenge on her father‚Äôs killer, Joel. 

When placed within a different context, we sympathise with Abby. By understanding the story from her perceptive, we truly feel the weight of Joel‚Äôs actions. We are being told that actions have consequences. This is something we must deal with, and the game is wanting us to listen to the other instead of being hot-headed. Sending death threats is not the answer. It achieves nothing except prove one‚Äôs ignorance. 

Ellie‚Äôs grief reflects this hot-headed, impulsive nature. Just like Abby, Ellie wants revenge and she lets it consume her existence. Abby and Ellie are very much alike. Ellie is willing to do whatever it takes to find and kill Abby, and she prioritises it over the safety of her friends. She is driven by her anger. Ellie has been wronged and she is unwilling to listen to the other‚Äôs side. This is the biggest message Naughty Dog teaches us. 

Ellie‚Äôs immediate hatred for Abby overwhelms her and her grief takes over. Her actions are impulsive and she proceeds without hesitation. Ellie‚Äôs early actions reflect those of the negative reviewers of the game, and this is why I claim that life has imitated art. The majority of haters of the game have struggled to grasp the meaning of Naughty Dog‚Äôs story as they refuse to accept Abby. 

The haters have failed to truly walk in the other‚Äôs shoes, despite playing as ‚Äòthe villain‚Äô for 10 or more hours. Just like Ellie, their immediate dislike of Joel‚Äôs death overwhelmed them and they acted ‚Äì in the form of death threats. Yet, unlike these haters, Ellie does take a step back during the final moments of the game. Here, the story teaches the importance of forgiveness and acceptance, something that has gone past the majority of fans.",2020-07-20T15:32:48Z,0,3

The graphics, sound, soundtrack, level design, animations etc are all top notch and pushes current gen to the absolute max; but the story and writing is sooo bad that that is what ultimately kills this game.

If they had you start off as Abby from the beginning with her as a kid, have her look like a normal woman instead of a beefed up transgender hulk, and made her more sympathetic throughout then maybe it could have made her more likeable. If they kept Joel in the game for at least 5 hours and given more moments between him and Ellie, and interactions with Dina and Jesse.

I completely understand the route that Neil wanted to go, but it just didn't deliver whatsoever. It COULD have worked, but maybe for a Part 3. Everyone wanted to see more of Joel and Ellie together at least for one more game, and they fucked it up.",2020-07-19T20:04:20Z,8,15

The ending was not my favorite but some one said it looked like ellie didn't just get back to her house, she didn't have all her gear on her so maybe she has been back in Jackson for some time and she just went back to the house to really say goodbye to Joel.

The week prior, I replayed the original to refresh the story in my mind. Because of this, I could see the difference was night & day. LoU1 had flashbacks that made sense. LoU2 forced us to go back with unlikeable characters and relive contrived events. In the original, I actually hesitated as Joel when confronting the doctors (including Abby's dad). I decided they would try to stop us later so I had to protect Ellie's future. Why though in LoU2 do chacters motivated by revenge lose everything in its pursuit only to change their minds?

The fact that people disliked this game really shows that this game has placed a mirror in front of society and the reaction tells me that people only care for their agenda and don't want to walk in the shoes of others.,2020-07-19T02:33:29Z,5,4

I was a huge fan, then I couldn't stand you bc of your ignorance and inability to see what liberal, pc, authoritarian leftism was doing to gaming. But, I am thankful that you FINALLY get it. You definitely see what it has done to gaming and how this infection continues to spread. I'm glad you are passionate about fighting back against this, bc trust me, if it continues, gaming will be a shell of its former self, and if it continues to get worse, you could be out of a job. This game is a perfect example. 7 years we waited!!! It's abundantly clear what the focus was from the developers and writers, and what the majority of their time was devoted to. It certainly wasn't on telling a good story. It was about gender. And subverting assumptions people have based on gender and the way people look. AWESOME!!!!!!

Trying to find reasons to justify why I couldn't like a game where they killed Joel right in the beginning. And I get it, this game could've had waaay more fan service to please us. Unfortunately art doesn't work based on what people want. It is made to cause an impact and transmits a msg

The thing is that this game doesn't give a shit about whether Joel and Ellie were protagonists or not, it's a game about people in that cruel world.
People that make right and wrong decisions.
Joel telling his name is no surprise, he has clearly been doing that since game one. And he did some nasty shit 20 years before he met Ellie, so if he were to be scared of mentioning his name he would never have done that even before meeting Abby.

And clearly that wouldn't make a difference because during the heat of the moment he mentioned his name to to her.

So he was dead before getting inside that house with Abby and her crew. She could've shot him in the face at any moment if he had decided to leave.

About the ending, I think killing Abby would've made the whole game and suffering pointless.
Like.. ok revenge.. nice.
Well that doesn't bring back the dead.

Ellie's last bit of humanity was saved by her realization that chocking Abby wouldn't make things different for her.
Actually that would be the final brutal act to a feeling that would never be gone.


I do agree with something though.
I didn't care about Abby, in fact I hated the character. I guess this is only obvious since Joel was part lf my group and not her. However, I do understand her. And this is that uncomfortable spot that the game puts you on.
Like in real life we hate people, but seeing their motives is not what we care about. And this is the beauty of TLoU2. 

For me this game made something waaay different than what I expected. Not a single other game made me experience hatred and sadness like this one.

Revenge never pays off in real life. The price is too high to be paid.
I'm probably not playing this game again because one time is enough to experience all this negative feelings.

The way I see it, Neil took a gamble instead of bringing another safe hero's Journey.

I'd love to play more with Joel before he got murdered. I'd like the game to be shorter and maybe divided in two games, but I can only appreciate Naughty Dog for delivering something new and bold.

This game was not about Joel and Ellie alone, The Last of Us became something much bigger.

Put aside the whole LGBT agenda (to each their own) my problem is how much of a little bitch they made Ellie. Joel risked his life to take her across the US and decided she was more precious then humanity itself, risked his life again to get her out of the hospital and pretty much adopted her into his heart as his daughter, only for the developers to make her resent him for saving her and loving her and bitching at him every encounter they had. Then when he dies to She-Hulk now she cares for Joel? Get the fuck out of here. Non sense feminism crap.",2020-07-18T13:44:26Z,0,4

If it wasn't so draining I would've played it again already. But even still, I'm already planning on playing it on the PS5 as soon as I can get my hands on it.

Less than 10 minutes into the video, and Joe's biases are clearly shown to have influenced the rest of the game. He thinks it's a negative that Joel's death made him mad? That's exactly what Naughty Dog wanted him to feel. They wanted it to suck and for you to hate Abby. They accomplished it brilliantly.",2020-07-18T12:13:05Z,7,2

Kind of like in Arkham knight. 

That way Joel could‚Äôve been in the entire game and it would‚Äôve given way more screen time with him and Ellie together, talking about the past, reminiscing and Ellie explains to Joel why she had to do  do it.

I thought that‚Äôs what it was hinting at in the trailers with Joel saying ‚Äúare you really gonna go through with this‚Äù. 

But no we barely saw Joel haha.

Edit: that way Joel still dies so there‚Äôs a meaningful death (rather than Dina dying and Ellie going to avenge her, when she‚Äôs only just been introduced) and we get to see the conflict in Ellie, and we get to see some closure with her and Joel (even if it‚Äôs not actually him)",2020-07-18T10:59:23Z,20,239

I've got an idea though how about the last of us two takes the Z nation route. Like have Joel and ellie meet a pregnant lady in the process of turning and after a certain amount of time have her  give birth to some wierd ass hybrid being what grows at a fast pace. Joel could  still die but in a meaningful way which means that ellie has to take on the role of guardian to this kid who possibly is the ultimate key to finding a cure.

You could see through every step that she took towards finding her, she was losing a piece of herself. She was shaken by what she did to Nora, and you can even see in that scene that she doesn‚Äôt really want to be hurting her, and is conflicted by what she‚Äôs becoming. And then when she kills Mel and realizes she‚Äôs pregnant, she basically has a panic attack and starts to shut down. Her quest for revenge brought her nothing but loss, heartbreak, and losing her humanity piece by piece. The Last of Us Part II isn‚Äôt a story of revenge. It has a plot line of revenge, but the story is based around forgiveness. Ellie was destroyed by the fact that she never forgave Joel while he was alive. That‚Äôs why she stopped killing Abby when she thought about that night on the porch with Joel. She thought the only way to reconcile and bury the pain of losing Joel was to kill Abby. When it was really in her ability to forgive Abby for what she had done. If you weren‚Äôt hoping that Ellie would forgive Abby and just walk away by the end of the game, then you must not have really had Ellie‚Äôs best in mind. 

Also, if you notice at the end of the game, Naughty Dog drops hints that Ellie is not alone, and is back in Jackson with Dina and JJ. Ellie does not have any of her weapons with her, she is wearing the same brown boots that she‚Äôs wearing in the flash back to the porch, and she has Dina‚Äôs bracelet on. I think she went back to their house to say goodbye to Joel, and signify that she forgives him. I thought this was a complex, highly emotional and well thought out story with incredible characters all along the way. And I applaud Naughty Dog for it.",2020-07-18T02:24:52Z,7,4

Those are my review scores at least. Believe it or not, I spent just over 46 hours on my play-through of The Last of Us: Part II, playing on moderate difficulty, and exploring the hell out of that world! It was remarkable for sure, but the game is nowhere near as good as the first entry. It was a modest disappointment in all honesty. üòì",2020-07-18T01:22:39Z,0,6

I think you underestimated the power of stup,idity and incompetence.  Not even 70 years in making would fix that. Actually, this is one of those cases, where the more time its spent, the worse it will be the final product. Why? Because with less time, they would have less opportunities to think of and add du.mb things.",2020-07-18T00:35:12Z,0,8

I'm disappointed that you didnt take a deeper look and examine WHY you are upset when joel is killed by abby and how seeing the story through abby's eyes literally changes the perspective of good and bad. You are supposed to go 'fuck Abby all i wanna do is kill her."" and then you walk a mile in her shoes and are supposed to ask yourself if you still want to do it. This is not Joels story and was clearly never intended to be so I dont see how you can get mad that Joel isnt in it very much. He is a primer for the revenge plot that follows.",2020-07-17T23:40:54Z,8,2

Whether it is Ellie getting revenge for what had happened to her or whether it is hoping to get what you want from a video game's ending - you are not entitled to what you want. This game is a piece of art and what is done is done. You cannot change the story or the action of the characters because it is not yours to create and to pontificate on how it could have been or should have been is both an insult to the work of the people who had made this game and to the truth that you deny yourself. I would ask you to try and not think about what you had wanted but what you had experienced. Try and think about this, for example. Ellie is capable of playing the guitar at the beginning of the game and she tries to play Joel's song at the end. Joel had taught her how to play the guitar and this is the best of his legacy but Ellie's way of revenge did not achieve anything and just lead Ellie to demolish Joel's legacy. And even if she kills Abby she won't find peace. And this thing was shown from Abby's perspective: after she had killed Joel, she didn't get rid of her nightmares. She saw her father in her dream alive only after she helped someone. You are more than welcomed to look at life backwards but you should be well aware to live it forward.",2020-07-17T20:52:10Z,0,0

They went out of their way to make it personal, the brutal murder of Joel. This had a much deeper meaning though. At its surface it seemes just out of place but once you experience the full game you get the message within. Liberal/femmenist fucks said to their customers, This is the death of Alpha Male role models /heros. With the way they killed Joel off and then added more slaps to the square jaw faces of Alpha males by having WOMEN blast every single Lead role by males in the game. Literally every other cut scene was a dude you just started to ""get to know"" as a supporting role getting blasted in the fucking head. Just like how an artist's drug addiction bleeds through their music, so does the mindset of the developers of this game. Fuck them, they are disgusting and I sincerely want my money back for that disaster of a PC coddling fuckery of a game. Imagine if a game came out specifically with cutscenes deliberatly murdering THEIR side of the political spectrum. Again, its not about Joel or any other character. This is about the obvious message they sent to customers paying for their bull shit. Fuck you Naughty Dog.",2020-07-17T20:09:15Z,0,1

But, they took risks, and they wanted to break the way we see characters as either an Antagonist or a Protagonist, and the people we hate, are people too. (Sure, there are inconsistencies like you killing a bunch of people in between but that is because its a game, it would've been pretty boring if you only fought infected) Plus, hearing the spoilers before you played didn't help.

However I have to say, I completely and utterly avoided any sort of spoiler for this game because I wanted to experience it for myself and judge it myself. All I knew was that people disliked it. When it released I bought it Day one and played up to when Joel was killed. That being said, I fully expected going into this game that Joel was going to die. My thing was I felt too safe having him around. Yes he went through hell and back in the first game, but in the end he survived and he‚Äôs a badass as well so having him around just made me feel like nothing could end the journey. Killing him wasn‚Äôt the problem. But that death was the shittiest experience I have had in modern gaming and that in itself is saying a lot.",2020-07-17T15:36:42Z,0,0

You spend 40 minutes talking about what you didn't like about the story and mere 2 minutes on what is objectively outstanding in this game: graphics (what about dozens of stores completely different from each other with a level of detail never seen before in a videogame), facial expressions, animations, combat smoothness, level variety and much more. Sure, you can love or hate the story, but let's try to be objective next time. You clearly ruined your playthrough because of the leaks: why would you try to kill Abbey at the beginning of the game? You should have no opinion on her during that phase of the game. But no, you hated her already; well, you hated the entire game already before even starting it.

It hurt because the first one was so great & this one wasn‚Äôt even more of the same. 

It was emotionless & made me feel cheated out of the time I spent on it. I feel like I went through hours of extensive dental work without Novocaine just to have the same messed up Grinch teeth I had to begin with along with all this unnecessary pain & frustration. It‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúWHAT DA FUCK WAS THE POINT OF THAT?!‚Äù

It's about how grief can be a driving force that leads to nowhere good if it's not dealt with in a healthy way. Both Abby and Ellie are grief stricken people who go to extreme lengths to try and console said grief. 

Abby finds a way come to terms with her grief through killing Joel and but then also faces the consequences of that when all of her friends distance themselves from her and then are subsequently killed. 

Ellie is a grief stricken/PTSD suffering person who goes to extreme lengths to cope with her grief. She goes so far that she manages to isolate herself from all the people who love her and to get some of her friends injured and killed. 

The simple point of this story is you can't decide who someone is until you walk a mile in their shoes. People are people, and everyone lives a different life despite how similar a background they come from. People don't like this because it has a realistic outcome.

If you had played with Joel for ten hours in this game there would be no way to try and redeem Abby which is what they were going for. This was an experiment in which you get to see both sides of the story and then you find out they're two sides of the same coin.

It's okay that it didn't work on you. That's how life is. Some people are willing to forgive and try to see the other side and some people aren't. 

It's just sad that you missed that point. 

One last thing: Girlfriend reviews pointed out that the first game was in the same vein story wise. The plot was about getting an immune person to a base to help develop a cure (which is subverted at the end) but the story was about a man finding a relationship with someone that he had previously lost and failed to grieve. This game is about getting revenge plot wise, but the story is about dealing with your grief and the consequences that follow. 

I love your reviews by the way, I just disagree with you here.",2020-07-17T02:46:47Z,2,3

Was the absolute highlight of the year and will probably never cease to be my most favourite game in my ps4 library. I thought everything, especially gameplay, character and the execution of the story was extremely well made and a big step up from the first game. The first time a game really made me cry on this level, feel anxious for two rivaling characters at once and get pumped up because of all the amazing and crazy action sequences. To be honest this review sounded more like you couldn't see anything objectively and got really hung up on the one thing this game managed to present so well: The cause, the reason and the effects of joels death. After this one death you seem to ignore any other character, no matter how interesting and try to underline how pissed you are that this one character you liked in the first game  is not there anymore. I can imagine that you couldn't appreciate this amazing atmosphere and environment with all those disrupting negativity instead of sitting in a darkened room with headphones while being completely absorbed in this emotional rollercoaster. 10/10 I do not find you sexist, but I do think that you really did not approach this game well. Im honestly sad that you missed out on that because in reality this game is much much more than what you list in this 50 minutes, where most of the time I just hear you crying about Joels death.  .",2020-07-17T02:37:31Z,0,4

Joel was suppose to live way much longer in the game, him and Ellie were suppose to save Abby from the accult. Joel wasn't immediately recognized by Abby because Joel was old. A friendship did bond.

If Joe wasn't seeing red the whole time he might have actually picked up on that. I really wonder how Joe will feel about this review in a few months from now, when he's had time to cool off and can look at the game from a professional standpoint, maybe even replay it on his own. I know being Angry is his shtick, but here it just came off as childish. Not to mention, even if you don't enjoy someone's story, it's so crude to call them a BAD writer.  Just because Joe doesn't care about the story doesn't make the story bad, little alone badly written. This game deserves at the very least an 8, if not a 9. Again, I'll be very interested to see how Joe feels about this video a few months from now.",2020-07-16T16:42:24Z,0,0

I let her die hundreds of times. I didnt know u play as abby on first play through. I do think its not the end of the game. They shoulda just owned up that this was gonna have to lead to part 3.

They successfully did this in the first game with Joel even though he potentially doomed humanity because he did out of love for someone else instead of hate. Abby should‚Äôve been introduced by becoming entangled with events that would‚Äôve brought her some development and understanding. and for god sake you don‚Äôt kill off the your best weapon to win over the audience of the game in the first two hours 

I‚Äôm gonna get a lot of hate for saying this but they definitely done Abby dirty in this game just as they did Joel I honestly believe that they were capable of making Abby a sympathetic character even after she killed Joel if she showed some sort of inner conflict for killing before or after killing Abby then she would‚Äôve been much better than she was in the game, maybe not likable, but at least understood enough for the audience to support some sort of compromise between her and Ellie instead of people chanting for her death. we see hardly any of that during her portion after Joel‚Äôs death with most of her friends supporting her for brutally beating a man to death it would‚Äôve been better for her friends to disagree with her quest for revenge and leave her to do it alone like how they treated Ellie in the game I honestly feel Like the game should‚Äôve stayed indefinitely delayed so they could‚Äôve made some changes or just make an entire different game starring Abby I believe the last of us deserved a sequel that respected the original but they took too many short cuts in their pacing for what we got and I‚Äôm pretty sure that if they made a prequel first or a spinoff either based on what kind of man Joel was during the first years of the apocalypse or the consequences of his choice in the first game that affected others then we might‚Äôve been more lenient on how he was treated and showing that his choice perhaps was selfish which a lot of people still do

It‚Äôs sad that the only new characters I actually liked were Dina Jesse Lev and Yara (even if she didn‚Äôt get much development) Also the other older characters besides Ellie like tommy or Marie were also written off poorly as well which was another flaw in the game I‚Äôm also pretty sure they would‚Äôve killed off tommy too if they had another way of moving the plot forward when Ellie finds out where Abby is and Marie is just forgotten about after Ellie and Dina left for Seattle.

and of course are lord and savior..

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-sTlYUeT8o,The Last of Us Part II - Angry Review,2020-07-02T02:32:07Z,@mogoggle,"Love me some Angry Joe, but man, I feel like Joe just read the spoilers and made up his mind about the game before even playing it. Evidenced by how Joe says during his playthrough that he's disgusted he has to play as Abby after she kills Joel, though there is nothing to lead the player to believe that they will be playing as Abby after that point. It's only something you'd know about if you read spoilers.

Joe's childish reaction to Abby's sex scene was pretty cringy, too. They're just tits, man. The writers didn't ""throw"" that sex scene in to make us like Abby, either. It was in there to show how different Abby is from Ellie. It was meant to show how Abby is turned on by violence. She's a sadist, driven by violence. She even admits this when her ""friend"" calls her a piece of shit. I think a lot of these important differences went right over Joe's head, again because he already had made up his mind and was just looking for excuses to hate. These differences are further shown by how she plays- she's a clunky berserker/brawler with heavy fuckin footsteps. Contrasting Ellie's rabbit-light footsteps and stealthiness. Abby gets better weapons because she comes from a well-fed army of thousands. It's the reason why she's so buff and healthy, compared to Ellie who is frail, with weapons that have been scavenged and cobbled together. Hell, she's blonde because Ellie is a brunette. Early concept art shows that Abby was going to be brunette as well, but the creators wanted to contrast the characters even more, so they made her blonde. Abby's size was obviously very purposeful, as well, in order to better show her downfall over the course of the game, as she wastes away into a shell of her former self.

Joe's complaint about Ellie's story being nothing but misery, while Abby's story was nothing but happiness and rainbows is super flimsy as well. Both characters go through an insane amount of hardship. Ellie loses her father figure and some friends (yes, Jessie had an abrupt death, but that's the world of TLOU for you- not everybody gets to go out guns-a-blazing like a hero) but Abby loses fuckin EVERYTHING, from her WLF friends, her rank, even her hair, backpack, and muscles! She loses everything except Lev. Abby gets a sex scene, but so does Ellie! Did you forget about Dina? They got to smoke weed and chill. Ellie even gets a taste of the good life, living on a farm with Dina and J.J. I'm not defending Abby here, she's still a garbage person, but give credit where credit is due.

Lastly, Ellie leaving that good life on the farm to go hunt down Abby may be hard to understand and relate to for some people. Anyone suffering from or is well-educated about PTSD will completely understand. Even if you're living in the lap of luxury, those voices and visions will be just as real as the event that started them. People cope with PTSD and other mental disorders differently. Ellie felt that the only way to kill the horrors in her head, was to kill Abby. At the end, I was incredibly impressed with her restraint with Abby. In that moment, she was the bigger woman. I think the writers did a phenomenal job creating and building upon believable characters. (Though I agree, Mel doing all that shit while pregnant was a bit of a stretch. To her defense, she wasn't supposed to be involved in any combat- they were ambushed while heading to another base while driving through territory that was supposed to be clear.)

Oh, and about gameplay innovation - The Last of Us 1 wasn't very innovative compared to other games, but everything it did, it did excellently. Same with The Last of Us 2, though I would argue that there is more innovation in TLOU2 than TLOU1: Being able to swim and hide in knee-high water, quickly shimmying through gaps, being able to smash and jump through glass windows, every soldier having names that were called out added to the immersion and story, the rope physics puzzles, and detailed weapon upgrading all come to mind as far as innovation in the series goes.

Your mileage may vary, though. These are just my thoughts on the game.",2020-07-16T00:43:28Z,3,2

Better gameplay, better story, much more interesting characters...if that's what Druckmann intended, then mission accomplished.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-sTlYUeT8o,The Last of Us Part II - Angry Review,2020-07-02T02:32:07Z,@0NBru,"What I truly fail to understand is how most people that hated the game because of the way the character of Joel was treated can so easily forgive Joel for all the horrible things he did but, at the same time, seem to make a tremendous effort to hate the character of Abby. I mean, I love the way Joel is written, but exactly for the fact that he is a morally complex character. The end of the first game, when you stop to think about it, isn‚Äôt as beautiful as Joe describes it: Joel kills a bunch of innocent people for selfish reasons and end up lying for his loved one to cover the fact that he is a borderline sociopath. That makes him an evil person automatically? Are his violent acts beyond forgiveness? Well, it depends from witch point of view we are depicting the facts: 
(i) For Abby, a random dude came into her house, killed all her friends and her father that was minutes away from saving all humanity from centuries of suffering. 
(ii) For Joel, a group of people were about to kill his daughter and he would do anything for love. 
That‚Äôs why Joe‚Äôs review makes utterly no sense to me. All the hate towards the effort of the script to humanize the character of Abby (because how could she play with a dog?? She is an evil killer!) doesn‚Äôt exist towards the character of Joel, who is equally violent. Us, as an audience, have a tendency to like Joel simply because we experienced the story from his point of view in the first game, and thus the script made us empathize with him. The boldness of the story of this second game is precisely testing our capacity to empathize with an character with the same moral ambiguity as Joel, but that would traditionally be depicted as the villain in an story that only focuses in the ‚Äúheroes‚Äù point of view. If the first game focused only on Abby and showed us this stranger killing our father, the player would simply hate Joel for the same reasons that we tend to hate Abby in the second game. 
So my felling is this: maybe the problem that made Joe and other people so angry with the game isn‚Äôt in the game at all, but in the audience itself, that simply wants to blindly hate a character, no matter how morally complex the problem given by the game truly is. The game presents a cycle of violence that could only be broken by giving up on progressing on it, that‚Äôs the whole point of not killing Abby by the end. So when Joe asks in the review ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point of all of this then???‚Äù, it seems he was so focused on hating the character that he missed all the good moral questions the story brings. 
So it‚Äôs truly sad to realize that maybe part of the gaming community isn‚Äôt really ready for getting out of their comfort zone and looking at violence not as a banal deed, but as a choice that has weight. 
I don‚Äôt like writing youtube comments. It‚Äôs just that this game made me think a lot about the role of violence in videogames and in society. I guess that in some level the discussion it‚Äôs bringing up in the gaming community, apart from the few people that propagate hate speeches, is good. I wished I could talk in detail with someone that hated those aspects of the game",2020-07-15T16:22:47Z,4,7

Joel was apparent ruthless/a monster. That is implied by Tommy when Joel comes for his help in the first game. Joel basically told Tommy that Joel was the reason he was alive, but Tommy tells Joel it wasn't worth it, not nearly worth it. Also, Joel uses torture multiple times as an interrogation method. When he went looking for Ellie after David captured her and when he searches for Ellie operating room in the hospital. In both instance Joel kills the people he interrogated. Joel killed Abby father to insured that Ellie's immunity would be worthless. You can not create a cure without a scientist/doctor who is capable of creating a cure from someone who has an immunity to the infection. Not just any scientist/doctor is capable of doing that, so there was no need to kill Marlene in the end of the first game, but Joel did kill Marlene. Joel told Ellie he would do it all over again to save her in the second game flashback. Joel was a selfish ruthless killer. Joel was older than Abby before the outbreak, yet Abby was able to let Dina and Ellie live after Ellie killed a pregnant Mel, Owen and the rest of Abby's friends. I don't believe Joel was capable of forgiving someone if he or she murdered Ellie, Tommy, Maria and Bill. Granted just like Joel Abby was a ruthless killer, for she was the most lethal Seraphites aka Scars killer among the members of the Washington Liberation Front. Unlike Joel, Abby was able to allow her enemies to live by the last one third of the game, but the much older Joel was not able to do that in the first game and did not regret his actions, for he told Ellie in the second game that he would do it all over again. Also, from Wiki Fandom Joel profile ""Over the years, the pair survived by descending into a sinister way of life, hurting innocent people; going so far as killing them; all to survive. Joel tortured, deceived, and killed countless innocent people, becoming a hunter. He adopted tactics such as tricking passersby into thinking he was hurt so he, Tommy, and likely others could ambush them when they let their guard down."" So, Joel was worse than Abby. I don't understand the hate for Abby if you finished the game. If the first game was made about Abby and her father in search for someone who is immune to the infection and learn about Ellie from a witness who seen Ellie breathe spores and we spent the majority of the game bonding with those two doing similar stuff like Joel and Ellie did in the first game such as having small talk developing the characters and having encounters with side characters like Bill and David. Abby's father kills Joel in a fight to retrieve Ellie to make a cure and Ellie manage to escape at the end of the game before the operation. We would think Joel was selfish for choosing Ellie over the world, especially if we spent the same small amount of time with Joel as we did with Abby's father in the first game. We would understand Joel perspective, but disagree with it since our bond would have been made with Abby and her father after spending the majority of the game bonding with them on their journey to find someone immune to the infection. In this alternative second game five years later it is a muscular Ellie kills Abby father to avenge Joel's murder during the first alternative game, than we would essential have a role reversal between Ellie and Abby character where Abby would be seeking revenge by attempting to kill Ellie for murdering her father in the beginning of the second game. People would hate Ellie and be cheering for Abby to kill Ellie if they didn't finish the game to discover that this isn't a story of revenge, but a story of understanding and letting go of hate, so one can move on and stop the cycle of hate and murder.",2020-07-15T11:12:42Z,0,0

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-sTlYUeT8o,The Last of Us Part II - Angry Review,2020-07-02T02:32:07Z,@yashdwivedi2037,"My interpretation explaining the transition from ""kill Abby"" to ""let Abby go"":
1) Guitar playing is a symbol of the strong, loving bond between Ellie and Joel
2) Abby biting off Ellie's fingers triggers thoughts of losing ability to play guitar, and that bond.  Soundtrack song ""Grieving"" begins playing in the background.
3) She has flashes of memories of her final conversation with Joel playing the guitar, where they talk second chances and forgiving.
4) Ellie realizes how much she has lost/sacrificed in her mad quest for vengeance.
5) Instead of seeing a reflection of herself in the water, she sees Abby (now physically a shell of her former self) seconds away from drowning.  I see this as a view into Ellie's soul.
6) Ellie relents after realizing how killing Abby will not bring any satisfaction, nor bring back anybody or anything she's lost.

We've already seen how killing Joel didn't eliminate Abby's nightmares.  They went away only after saving the lives of Yara and Lev, and finally replaced with her father smiling back at her.  This is how Abby found peace and moved on from her father's murder (i.e. not through revenge).

The ending is depressing, but there is hope.  The moth symbol signifies change, and shown in the opening scenes of the game with Joel.  He is no longer the violent, angry man in the first game, and is now instead given a second chance at being a kind, loving father, who plays guitar and drinks coffee like in pre-pandemic days.  

The story closes with a shot of the same moth symbol.  If Ellie has indeed changed and abandoned her fool's quest for revenge, then she is deserving of being forgiven by Dina.  She might be alone for now (her worst fear), but there is hope she will be reunited with her family.",2020-07-15T10:13:46Z,0,0

Most of the people in the game are pretty athletic or built strong because thats what it would take to survive, think about it, how many fatties do you really see in tlou?",2020-07-15T08:48:41Z,2,0

And I am a little shocked that you would kill a pregnant person. If that is true you are simply a bad man. But that is the problem isn't it? You can't handle the fact, that Abby isn't a bad person. You want to hate her, but she did not do anything Ellie and Joel wouldn't do so you can't hate her which means the game reached its goal.
Actually there isn't a real evil person dispite the infectet.

But that is OK. Your 6 tells me only, that it is a masterpiece and not everyone can handle this complex matter.

Remember lots of people loved the multiplayer as well which has no real narrative to it.

I had pre-ordered this game because the first one was and is my favorite ever and I had big hopes and expectations for the 2. But unfortunately it was a disappointment to me.

I finished it and my own personal estimation of the rating is 6/10. And this just for the scenes that I played with Joel and Ellie.

The Abby's ark that is about 80-90% of the main game story, it was so boring compared to part 1. And the whole story was like I was playing the walking dead tv show in a game. The end was like the season with the Nigan.

No doubt that part 2 was a different story before and in 2017 things changed and story changed. Wasn't random at all that one of the directors left Naughty Dog in 2017 in the middle of development. And this director worked in part 1 and uncharted 4.

Well I hope ND got the message of failing this franchise and they will take it from the scratch again by learning to listen and respect their fans opinions. And of course I am talking for the normal and polite opinions and fans.

Not the abusing etc. The review was really deep and funny at the same time buddy. Good job üëç",2020-07-15T00:42:33Z,3,8

It represents Neil and everything he hates. Abby is his wet dream and the whole thing is about how he screwed the game and everyone who was a fan of the first game. The dogs in the game represent naughty dog and how much they love Neil through Abby and the player gets to kill the dogs showing how much they hate Neil. Neil knew this is how everyone would feel about it and he is laughing over that fact.  It is a complete psychological breakdown of Neil's mind set.

There's an attempt in here somewhere to explain the opinion but really all we get is an absolute load of waffle and about 5 minutes actually looking at the game mechanics, graphics, music etc.

There may be pacing issues with the story but the structure does work - First we play as Ellie, a character we all love and know well. Joel is horrifically murdered and it's hard to take. We as players feel the red mist and the revenge that Ellie wants. Then the carpet is pulled from under us. We're put in the shoes of the person we're desperately hunting. Are Abby's intentions just as valid as Ellie's? The simple answer is yes - As far as they (Abby and crew) were aware, Joel took from the world the one and only chance to save humanity. Let alone killing her dad in cold blood.

IMAGINE MAKING A LIVING OUT OF GAME REVIEWS and then this game comes along... with the best graphics we've ever known, some of the best, top tier, gritty AF gameplay, interesting dialogue and one of the most emotionally investing stories of our entire generation and you guys sit in a room and reduce it to 'I dont like it because my favourite character died'.

Putting in that sex scene is EXACTLY the kind of thing the LGBT...ect... are supposed to be against. That was clearly exploitation of a faminine body (the ONLY time the older version of the main character was truly posed as female, but only by technicality). Was the Main character even of legal consenting age? She went from this 11-13ish looking girl to some late teens looking thug-ish knock off. Are they trying to condone and endorse pedophilia?

This is exactly why I am extremely picky about buying games now. I won't even touch 'em until they've been publicly reviewed. There's always an agenda behind the plot, trying to convince the gamer of something, there's rarely just good old fashion fun or well developed plot lines anymore.
People like Joe need to be supported, cuz honestly they're the only source of moderation and accountability gaming companies have anymore. Gaming companies that push this agenda need to be hurt through their wallets and game reviewers like Joe are the only real way we have left of doing that. Let them filter out the shit games for us so that we don't end up giving these companies money for terrible work.

I personally interpreted the game to not be about Ellie at all. And perhaps that is the source of some of the division? It seems a lot of people are disappointed in all the Ellie/Joel stuff but it just felt bigger than that to me ya know? The themes extend beyond her own journey (like the faction wars and Yara/Lev and such). Ellie just kinda served as a grounding point for me idk. Seemed more like the game wanted to force you to experience the lessons for yourself, and Ellie was just a piece of that.

He lost his daughter, after years of survival he found a surrogate second daughter. He literally sacrificed the worlds future to save his new daughter. EVERYONE can empathise with his decision. 

I have 2 kids, and my wife watching me play part 2 asked would you do what Joel did and I said ""hell yes, fuck the world you ain't killing my kid"". It's instinctual, you do anything, ANYTHING to protect your kids no matter how irrational in a world view it may be.

So this game essentially shits on his decision and also his decision to lie about it to Elle. It was selfish to lie yes but also the right thing to do at the time to keep peace and again, its a real life reaction. 

Nope Screw that, Joels a prick, deserved to die, everything he did was wrong and evil. Surviving by killing others isn't evil and they made it out to be.

1 level has you getting medical supplies to save a girl, you get them....she died in the next level.....an entire level completely fucking pointless. 

A game about revenge where the girl doesn't get her revenge, loses 2 fingers, loses her partner, her chance at a family, and all her friends along the way are killed or scarred for life....the end. Hope you enjoyed it......

No, no I didn't! And I can see why game stores are refusing trading it back in as there would be a flood of people to do so. 

The woke parts aren't even an issue for me. It makes sense Elle is lesbian, she's been surrounded by girls most her life, absence of men. It makes sense abby is built, she's had vengeance on her mind for years. It made sense.

Biggest issue though is what's left. First game is about the bond between 2 people in a mad world.

This game? Well he's dead and an asshole, and she's fucked her life trying to exact revenge on this asshole and not only doesn't kill the girl, but loses her surrogate father, her town friends in Jackson, her other friends killed, her 2 fingers bitten off so she can't even play guitar any more and the new family she could have had with dina and baby left her.....aren't you SO glad you waited 7 tucking years to enjoy.....that?!",2020-07-14T00:23:57Z,3,1

I feel if they do make a part 3 its not going to feature ellie at all. I feel like they just basically did what they did, and if they continue with the serious itll be based on Abby and Lev and their journey with the fireflies or whatever. If Ellie is in it in any way, its going to be short. Abby and Lev will search with the fireflies to find Ellie, make a cure, and then Ellie gets her purpose and Abby lives happily ever after. Which yeah would be a bullshit game cause no one gives a fuck about Abby and her weak ass story, but I feel like that's maybe why they tried to force her down our throats, and made Ellie so broken and alone.",2020-07-13T23:42:23Z,4,23

Like, you don't have to empathize with Abby if you don't want to. In fact, the game doesn't force anyone to empathize with her. I didn't empathize with her and neither did I find her part manipulative. I believe it's merely showing how twisted a person can become, even if you look ""normal"". The other problem is, her part can only play with your emotions and toy with mind if your definition of good or bad is based on human standards and not on an absolute standard. I mean, based on the standard I live by, no one is good. Not even one. Myself included and that's why her section doesn't effect me at all. What I mean is, she will never be a ""good"" person in my eyes, no matter what she does. Even Ellie's fall from grace into darkness and loneliness is completely possible, because no human is good. That's the reality.

However, for some redemption, ND needs to make a third game at least. You know, things look a little lost at this point and we definitely need to have a better end than this.",2020-07-13T22:50:39Z,1,1

I can see that Happening. It was more like a movie if you ask me. I personally would‚Äôve loved Ellie to kill Abby but in my opinion. Her and lev was another version of Ellie and Joel but in a different situation. The ending seems like she‚Äôs over Joel finally because she couldn‚Äôt been play his guitar which is big factor in the game of her remembering him. I hope we keep playing Ellie  and see her in the future of last of us  or franchise. The Company seems like they are ending Joel and Ellie story.... Now it‚Äôs going to be a Abby and lev story... Let‚Äôs hope for a DLC! I can see last of us 3 ether Ellie continuation or Abby and lev story.

The cycle of violence was the point!! At the end of the game you realize that Abby isn‚Äôt a bad person. She has her own perspective and her reasons and her reasons are justified throughout the game. It‚Äôs tooooo bad that Joel dies. It does but it‚Äôs amazing story telling for an apocalyptic world. Death is around the corner and that‚Äôs what we got.

1. Smart enemy AI. I've played TONS of games with smart enemy AI. What I can NEVER find is games with smart allied AI. If developers could actually do THAT, I'd be impressed. Developers do this ALL THE TIME. Your enemies = smart. Your allies = morons. Developers will always defend this by saying some nonsense about ""balance"". Balance is game developer code for cheap, unfair, bullshit. Balance only ever seems to apply when it's screwing the player rather than the enemies

2. Great graphics. It's 2020, what game DOESN'T have great graphics? I haven't played a game with bad graphics on my PS 4 in YEARS. Who the hell is still impressed by graphics in video games today?

ZERO unlockables - what happened to all the concept art/skins/filters/etc to unlock from the first game???

The story is just TOO tragic.  I can‚Äôt remember the last time I saw a story this depressing.  Nearly everyone dies or ends up broken and miserable by the end

No online multiplayer?? I am not kidding when I say I was really looking forward to this.  Naughty dog games always have multiplayer.  What happened? Tlou and uncharted both had multiplayer",2020-07-12T23:00:13Z,1,0

However the game play was really good twist and turns that I didn't expect (yes they r heavy handed in dealing with a new character) but I found that I enjoyed playing as said character after I was SUPER pissed then played through and enjoyed the new character (other then the obvious). Its also longer then I anticipated going almost 30 hrs but I did die alot it is a little boring numerous times and I found myself getting distracted but when the game is kicking on all cylinders it really was fantastic im glad I bought it but I did think naughty dog has earned (at least with me) the ability to take what chances they want considering there games are generally very good.

When I preordered this game I avoided any and all spoilers hoping that this would be half as good as the first game, but I was fucking wrong. I could live with the way Joel died. I could handle a simple revenge plot but forcing us to play as abby a character I wanted to gut like a fish for 10 HOURS. Was the worst fucking thing that made me hate this game. And let me tell you how hard it is to make me hate a game because I lived the game anthem. And that game wasn't that good, but at least it gave us some satisfaction playing, but no. In the last of us part 2 we get told that the entire fucling story was pointless and now ellie is alone. This game is a insult to fans and I will never trust Neil with any games.

And I rate it a 0/10  due to a story that was lazy and forces a bullshit message the only good thing was the graphics and the animation",2020-07-12T12:52:16Z,0,0

The only real problem is that the breaks in continuity feel extremely annoying when you first play the game. That and the story while certainly memorable is so completely miserable. I‚Äôm still not sure if I want to go through it again to be honest. But I think it‚Äôs much too good and too intelligently written to be a six. It‚Äôs at the very least, especially for a game of this high quality a 7/10. I‚Äôd probably be inclined to give it a high eight though, because most of the criticism is dependent on creative opinion. Gameplay, visuals and environments are all fantastic. I‚Äôve certainly never been able to play an acoustic guitar in a game before!",2020-07-12T12:24:06Z,0,3

1. The first game was long enough to completely exhaust the story out of any possible extension. If you had Joel and Elli again fans would have said same ol same.
2. Clearly Naughty Dog sees the last of us as their ultimate project for entries to come (with or without Neil Drukmann) adding more characters, more story twists, more drama layers and an attempt to more emotional connection (Abby & Lev) is imminent. Not everyone will appreciate that at first because how much fans loved Joel & Elli but give it time.
3. Social agendas, I agree with you at times was a bit too much and blown out of proportions to serve as any important pillar to the story, you have to always think this is part of our world conveyed in films, music, TV, theater where entire productions dedicated to it. If naughty dog didn‚Äôt do it someone else would have. 
I truly believe this is a game that we have to first fully comprehend, maybe a second or even a third walkthrough, get used to it‚Äôs characters, appreciate other aspects that were hardly mentioned by critics due to stuck on story and Joel‚Äôs death such as gameplay, combat, stealth, the gorgeous world and of course, music, voice acting etc. Like you did Joe in the begging of this review, throw it away for 3, 4,5 or even 6 months and then play it again.. you‚Äôll see what I mean.",2020-07-12T09:49:10Z,0,1

Why do people think this is a bad game?
Well here's some stuff to think
1)""Great"" Graphics - actually no, its 2020, I'd play Death Stranding or Doom Eternal, or fuck it, Tomb Raider games or etc etc, but you cant buy me with graphics, GRAPHICS ERA WAS DONE SINCE 2013 - GET OUTTA HERE
2)Rope Physics - Half-Life 2 did that back in the 2004
3)They try to give the reason for Joels death - Yep, by putting on some random NPC a name tag, making him kinda important, lol. Next time - some random zombie would cure itself and become a president we all need, but we killed him so yea, zombies will be angry
4)They try to make us look bad by looking at all these people we murdered - Yeah well, no, thats a bad choice at story telling. If you wanna impress me really bad - in the next game I wanna play as some random fat Scars lady and be like.
EY
SOME RANDOM TWO GRILLS KILLED ALL OF MY CHILDREN AND HUSBANDOS
I WANNA MAKE THEM EAT THEIR GUUUUUUUTTTS
5)Tolerance - its not fucking Tolerance when a giant Swarchz of a woman is beating up big men AND having a name - ABS. Its not fucking Tolerance when a cute girl became ugly after some years, rejecting a funny asian guy and then fucking with an INDIAN GIRL THAT IS FUCKING PREGNANT
6)Justified Ending - excuse me what. Why Ellie didnt killed ABS again? Why? She already murdered the whole god damn town, its could be a really good ending if Eilled finished the job but no. FEMS WON GG.
7)""Great"" Stealth Action - 10/10 enemies that showing me their backs
8)""Great"" Shooting Action - Laughs in Tomb Raider language
9)Ellie is not that great - ye well, such is life and Devs trying to demonize her in so many ways its disgusting
10)They care about the fans and the legacy - Yes, by killing every god damn charachter in the game, not even caring about good or bad people. Simply all are going to die. Great story telling.

Abby‚Äôs motivations for why she does what she does are genuinely compelling and closely mirror Ellie‚Äôs own quest for justice and retribution. Of course there are things that Naughty Dog does to try and humanize Abby but these things are absolutely plausible in the context of Abby‚Äôs character. Take the dogs, for instance. Abby is part of the WLF, which uses dogs for protection, so of course it makes sense that Abby would actually get to pet and interact with them. In contrast, these dogs try to kill Ellie so she has no choice but to kill them instead. As for Abby having access to better weapons, this also makes sense as Abby is part of a highly militarized group. Aside from these things, Abby‚Äôs relationship with Owen is similarly necessary - not only to the story but Abby‚Äôs larger character as well. The fact that we spend time learning about Abby and Owen is meant to show the player the extent of what‚Äôs affected by Ellie‚Äôs choices. I thought this was one of the most interesting aspects of Abby‚Äôs story, and I think the scenes involving both her and Owen were beautifully written. The scene in the boat was charged with sexual energy so I did not find it surprising when a brief fight quickly evolved into something more intimate. 

The choice that Naughty Dog makes in the beginning of the game is admittedly abrupt but the reasons for this are reveled to us throughout the story and while we may not like the consequences of that choice we ultimately we come to understand it. Without the pivotal event in the beginning of the game, there would have been no story, no reason for Ellie to set off on her quest. This event is the animating force behind the game, Ellie‚Äôs journey, the costs she endures, and who she ultimately becomes by the end.",2020-07-12T07:32:10Z,0,4

If you think what Abby did was wrong then you've gotta understand that what Ellie is doing is BAD. Murdering in the name of revenge is BAD regardless of who've you gotten attached. Owens deserves to die cause he cheated? I mean, UHHHWHAA? Not everything is so black and white.

I gotta say i'm not much of a fan of the gameplay, the humor was pretty good... I was surprised by how spot on Alex analysis is on the game and gaming in general.3/4 of this review are insights he gave during the playthrough. 

Hated the ending... If they were going for a dog eats dog world, then Ellie deserved her revenge. The point of no return lays when they killed Joel, that's the plot starter and that's where the character arc should had finished... Ellie is mature, can take care of herself and yes she is a killer...
I hate how they hand hold you like NONONONO Ellie can't be the bad guy and kill in revenge... Dude the whole game is littered with disposable NPCs for Ellie to Kill! Ellie was too far gone, they should had acknowledge that at least... It would be a good send off for the history, something like saying, this is not your average hero's journey, but instead they slammed the brakes at the moment most gamers were expecting closure.
Technically the game is a masterpiece, story wise is not... Killing Joel like that would've been good is they had double down on it... Like SHIT! they can kill anyone... to me that's not weird, not in the lore of the game at least. I'd love to see a main character die from some stupid trap or a random NPC  i swear... that could be good writing to keep you on your toes, to respect escorts missions and to not get comfortable, but no. They did it once for shock value, then plot armored the whole game, even the ending... There is nothing more frustrating than a game taking the control away from your hands and that was evident on that ending fight. At least give us a choice and let us live with that decision.",2020-07-12T03:49:49Z,0,0

All her friends fucking die! Were you paying attention? Also, the whole arc with Lev and Yara is her way of dealing with her guilt for what she did. To be clear, I don't think the game deserves a 10/10, maybe an 8 at best, which is the same score I would give to the first game.

If you‚Äôre too hung up on Joel‚Äôs death to fully embrace the rest of the story, don‚Äôt even bother with it. Joel‚Äôs death was early on, but that‚Äôs what sets the game in motion. It was great how Naughty Dog showed us the game from two different perspectives because it shows us that everyone is the hero of their own story. Abby had every right to kill Joel, but she shouldn‚Äôt have. As Ellie learns at the end of the game, sometimes revenge isn‚Äôt the answer. Sometimes you just need to accept the cards your dealt and move on with your life. Ellie, like a moth (which we see many times in the game,) transformed by the final scene and learned to accept. And if you‚Äôre mad that Ellie didn‚Äôt kill Abby, that‚Äôs stupid for two reasons. Joel killed Abby‚Äôs dad, so why is it not okay for her to get revenge but it‚Äôs okay for Ellie? The second reason is what I was talking about before. Ellie realized that killing Abby would solve nothing.

In fact, I agreed with your views before you stated them so eloquently here, which is why I NEVER BOUGHT THE GAME NOR DID ANY OF MY FRIENDS! HAHAHAHAH! 

Like hell is any game developer going to guilt me into buying anything. The moment that nonsense happened, it was already ""Game Over"".

As a side note, I really wanted to support your sponsor, Joe. You've made a clean break from your political days and I applaud you for keeping that bologna out of things and sticking to games as entertainment, a place where politics have no place. Unfortunately, your sponsor let you down, yep. They blew it. Even with your promo code, a single flavor came to $31.00 for a 30 serving size. What can I say? For you, Joe and for how good I think your stuff is, I'd take a shot. But $31.00!?! Kinda reminds me of certain game scams for skins that are way overpriced. I get 1 scoop of powder for 1 drink per day for a month for $1.04 each... It doesn't even come in cans or with carbonation and I have to mix the stuff myself! So, unfortunately, I couldn't do it. I can buy the same stuff in powder or liquid for less than 25% (¬º) of the price without your promo code from Walmart. Now, maybe the flavors aren't as exotic or trendy, but at quadruple the cost, I can't go for it. It's a synthetic sweetener mixed with powdered vitamins (The quality of which I am not entirely certain of. Low absorption  vitamins mean they can put them on the label but don't really uptake very well so, meh.) All things being equal, you're paying for their proprietary flavor which is likely fantastic... but that only gets you to double the price, $10.00 in my book and with shipping at $6.00+ bucks, that gets me to a total of $16.00+. At that price, ¬¢50+ per serving, it's something nice, something with a little flare and class. At $31.00+ it's just insulting. So, I love ya, Joe but, that's a hard pass for me. I'll probably just hit up your Patreon and give you the ~$15.00 I was ok with spending and let you NOT buy the stuff G-Fuel is selling... because $15.00 isn't enough to buy a powdered drink mix...

They don't kill Ellie or Tommy, BECAUSE THOSE WEREN'T THE ONES THEY WERE AFTER. It was just personal, and just so you know, since apparently you haven't been paying attention, one of Abby's crew was about to shot Ellie in the head, but Owen and Mel stopped him. Even Abby didnt care about tommy or Ellie, she wanted revenge, she got her revenge, and gave them a pass. She litterally says that to Ellie. ""We let you live and you just waste it"". You can do with Abby the same things that you get to do with Ellie. There's no bias, there's no better weapons, that's crap. If you were to make a valid argument about why you don't like the game, but you just don't. Why is it okay to show GUTTED PEOPLE, or to BLOW UP PEOPLE WITH EXPLOSIVE ARROWS (Arrows that if im not mistaken, ONLY ELLIE gets to make) or WATCH PEOPLE BEEN BEATED UP TO A PULP but not show sex? Why is it okay to show Ellie and Dina get intimate after they smoke some weed BUT NOT ABBY? You may not like the game, which is completely valid point, but to lie, to make it see like if the developers make Ellie a worse character than Abby gameplay-wise, is total bullshit, and it's made just to get on the hatetrain that's so popular nowadays.  It's sad that you, being a youtuber with almost 4 million subscribers, makes a 45 minute long video SCREAMING and lying to your whole audience, just because it's safe to say that you hate the game.",2020-07-11T23:06:25Z,3,3

Okay? Think of how WE right now wish we could go back to a world without covid. After 4 months.

And the one hope to fix that shit -- Gone. Kaput. By this man -- Joel. And to TOP IT OFF, he happens to be the man who also murdered your father.

To me, that doesn't sound like the typical ""oh just some character in the background who got angry, why does she matter?"" bullshit.
I'm not saying I didn't hate her guts, but once the game switched gears halfway through and started to show me the other side of the coin, I began to understand, and empathize. It's an exercise in empathy. You either pass it or fail it. I think, Joe, that you're not a very observant person in that regard. It shows.
Let's compare to Star Wars. Abby is not just some ""engineer who was working on the Death Star"" looking out for revenge. More like she was the daughter to the murdered diplomat who for sure could've put an end to the fucking galactic Civil War.

The story has its problems. I got pissed off during the theater confrontation where it suddenly cut to the flashback and was about to quit when ‚ÄúSeattle Day 1‚Äù popped up. Having replayed the start I would have wished we spent more time with Joel in order for us to connect again and then kill him. I found the end of Abby‚Äôs story to be good, but it still didn‚Äôt make me like Abby as much as Ellie. Although personally the theatre fight had me on the edge of my seat as I thought Ellie would die (something I accidentally read on twitter). I wouldn‚Äôt change anything about the content of the story but would definitely change the pacing and order of the flashbacks (play Abby at the start). Lastly, for some reason I kind of like Owen. Probably because of when he ‚Äúshould I go kill the people that killed my family‚Äù.",2020-07-11T20:54:22Z,0,0

This is the epitome of false praise. Graphical fidelity simply doesn't matter, it just has to be a consistent and satisfying style. Graphics are the single cherry on top of the cake of the entire game. You're essentially giving like 3 points for a fuc*ING cherry. Most of the good animation is just carried over from uncharted 4 and the textures are somehow lazy. Don't get me wrong, there was a lot of effort in most areas but then there's parts like in the containers in the rain with Abby where they copy paste the outside texture on the inside, making it rain indoors. And then there's the odd texture that looks so flat and low res compared to everything else  It's such perplexing laziness considering the agonizing effort put in elsewhere.
Also, the plot holes Joe. The reason Abby's crew went to Jackson, Dina's obsession with Ellie when no relationship is established, Abby's crew not knowing who Ellie is, Mel's pregnancy not being known by Abby in Jackson but being very apparent in Seattle.
And good AI? No. Just no. Play on hard and actually interact with the AI. Playing on easy makes the AI impossible to judge, you can run around randomly and then random AI movement looks intelligent by pure chance. On harder difficulties, you keep track of individuals and see their reactions. This AI is god-awful in every way a stealth AI can be.",2020-07-11T18:44:32Z,0,1

Practically nobody, including Ellie, had any real depth or growth. In the first game, practically all of the characters had their own motives and aspirations, which made some of their fates extremely heartbreaking. They felt like characters who were not completely tethered down by the narrative's main storyline or themes.
With The Last of Us Part 2, there was such a strong emphasis on the themes of ""revenge has consequences,"" ""not everyone is clear-cut,"" and ""violence impacts real people"" that, after a certain point, it made a lot of ""character moments"" (e.g: Alice the Dog, Abby's father saving the zebra, and Ellie suddenly challenging and then sparing Abby)¬†feel extremely manipulative and artificial, ruining its intended impact.
Honestly, with the exception of Abby and (kind of) Owen, nobody had any real depth/growth, which made their fates/decisions feel completely inorganic and hollow. It didn't help that ALL of the sendoffs were not given the same amount of time to be digested, compared to the sendoffs of Tess or Henry (or even, to an extent, David). Jesse was the only somewhat intriguing character, but his death was treated like such an afterthought that it reinforced the idea that these characters were ultimately only tools to serve the theme/narrative.",2020-07-11T18:03:15Z,0,5

 i wouldn't worry about Laura. i'd worry about the people giving out death threats. that's a crime and if you screen capture the death threat AND the link to the person who wrote it, you can report it to the police. proof death threats in some states are considered a terrorist act and in most states a felony. but the important thing is to report this to the police so that IT CAN BE ON OFFICIAL RECORD OF NOTE. if nothing happens, the important thing is to have a report with the captured screenshot of the death threat AND the link to the person who wrote it placed ON OFFICIAL POLICE RECORD!",2020-07-11T16:26:26Z,0,0

That's... not how reviews work, man. You review a game for what it is, not what you didn't get. If you block yourself off from liking a new character because you're so hung up on the first game's protagonists, it shows you don't actually care for the world-building in this story. You don't want it to grow, to expand, to challenge you by attacking that attachment you feel. That IS the point. But no, you're out for your own, shallow self-gratification.

In summary,
    A contender for the best graphics of 2020
    An incredible OST
    Great gameplay and controls
    Great script with ongoing narrative
    Great story that make you think
    The closest thing to Night of the Living Dead did for the horror movie industry with its upsetting backlash until it set itself as a monumental work
    Almost bug free at release, great quality control, the best of the industry in contrast with EA, Activision and Ubisoft behavior to release a broken game and fix it later
    No micro transaction, no scam and no money grab
    The best Collector Edition I can recollect of
    The Limited Edition console is one of the best looking console I have ever seen
I don't recall a game with such production beside God of War in the last 3 years, simple as that.",2020-07-11T12:59:49Z,0,2

Story-wise, i didn't care about any of the characters after Joel was killed; i didn't even hate them. The rest of the plot, as Joe said, was predictable and it was pretty obvious they were going for a ""revenge is bad"" ending. One cutscene would have been enough to show Abby's perspective without having to spend half of the game on her. They made Ellie selfish and dumb as a rock this time around. Dina was just another cookie-cutter concerned girlfriend character. Owen was a spoiled brat. The Cult members could have been replaced by more infected and it wouldn't have mattered at all (other than Lev's subplot). The Santa Barbara arc was pointless and could have been cut out completely without affecting the ending.
This game had so much fat that could have been trimmed to keep the story tight, focused AND story-driven, instead of the meandering predictable mess we got.

They talked about trying to be progressive but the only show sex shown is Abby and Owen but they can‚Äôt show the lesbian sex scene. The lesbian sex scene is made to seem shameful with Jesse catching them dressing while he was looking for them to help basically go save Joel. There is a strong possibility and leaning towards that If they hadn‚Äôt had done that and been upstairs they may have gotten to Joel sooner. On the other hand they can show Abby and Owen fully having sex whole OWEN IS CHEATING but nothing bad really comes from it and is not made to feel shameful in ANY way.,2020-07-11T11:48:44Z,0,0

Just wanna make that clear. I, in my opinion, really do not agree with a lot of the points you made in this video. There are some I agree with sure. Like the side characters not being as compelling as the characters in the first game. Anyway, I feel like that since you could not get over the fact that Abby killed Joel that you completely missed the point of why we played as her. They were trying to show that everyone thinks they are in the right in their own point of view. Like you thinking Abby is just nothing but evil for killing Joel. Abby wholeheartedly believes that she was in the complete right in doing what she did but even after doing it she wasn't satisfied and that IS told in her story and you see it but the fixation on not liking her because of killing Joel is a bit much. Like you didn't even want to give her a chance. I also want to point out that I ALSO HATED Abby when she killed Joel. I really did. At first I did not enjoy playing her but I got past that the more I delved into her story. Yes the story is nothing groundbreaking but they wanted to show that Abby and Ellie are parallel, going through the same experiences, having the exact same emotions in those situations. It's fine if you don't like it, I just hope you understood it. Because I loved how the story was told and how it ended felt right to me. I still love you and your videos.

At least thanks to this review I can see why people did not like the story. I think the whole point is that Abby took revenge on Joel for murdering her father, which is the same motivation that Ellie has throughout the game. Due to Ellie trying to accomplish her goal, she murders others which from the WLF perspective are good people. Basically everything is relative, people tend to think selfishly so their group is the correct and justified group and the ‚Äúout-group‚Äù are the enemies and their lives be damned. Also the Ellie vs Abby weapons and skills are not better or worse just different. Ellie is more tailored towards stealth since she is skinnier but has the knife, while Abby has been working out and is stronger for non-stealth combat. Thanks for the content and for your honest opinion. I just feel Joe may have missed the point in this one, perspective and empathy.",2020-07-11T09:32:50Z,1,2

I ended up liking Abby but was forever wrestling with what happened to Joel. Which flipped me back to Ellie but remembered that Ellie killed the dog! Oh and the pregnant lady. Right until the end I felt like either one could die or even both characters. I feel like people are upset because it isn't how they wanted the story to go.

It should have started with Abby instead. Commit to establish her character first and make the players care first about her before her moment to kill Joel. And the promotional stuff should have front and centered her instead of Ellie. That alone kinda made the ads about the game really scummy and misleading. We only played Ellie for about half the game.",2020-07-11T08:27:14Z,0,0

The gameplay and AI as well as environments are the best I‚Äôve seen. When I thought it was going to end the story did drag out yes. And ultimately if you are a hard core fan may be upset. But I‚Äôd say if you liked the first it‚Äôs still worth playing. In a world of Ubisoft A-B games it was nice to play and be in that world. It made me feel I need to ask more of modern games than the same decade or old formula. However the story and pacing does fall short in areas. I enjoyed the review but I feel if we set story aside it‚Äôs a great game. Some of the story and moments are even good and as mentioned, Abbys game play is some of the best. Some felt like dlc and the game is too long. Not sure the plans, but I read an article by Noel who said...the only way to continue past this point was to make a game like this. If this is true a 7 year wait is long and some may go back on the games story and we may get it more. But if they were to do this...a DLC giving us something else would have been proper to tie this ending up. Maybe a DLC with Dina or something to give a hint it‚Äôs not a closed loop. Personally I don‚Äôt think this is the last game at all. But it‚Äôs a hell of a way to leave it for the next 5-7 years, when it‚Äôs one of the biggest games out there. Any criticism is warranted, but it is still a fun game and grueling game you will remember and worth playing yourself. Don‚Äôt play with friends play it entirely alone by yourself. Yes you may be upset with the story... but it‚Äôll be a game you probably will have had a lot of fun with and ask more from other games to deliver.",2020-07-11T05:49:48Z,0,0

And I really was not at all disappointed. The story had so many beautiful moments, human ones and really made you rethink each characters motives the further the story went on. I wanted Ellie to have her revenge but after learning Abby's own motives I ended up sympathizing with both of them and not being able to decide either way. We all knew Joel did some questionable things in the 20 years prior to the first game, and in its conclusion we knew his motives to save Ellie would essentially ruin humanity's hope for possible continuation. Its about the repercussions of each of their actions. We already had an entire game of Joel and Ellies dynamic, im not sure that another repeat of the same formula would have been any better than how you reviewed this game.

I don't really get, that you enjoyed the first game (a mixture of all zombie movies ever made, a mediocre gameplay, great voice acting and superb story telling) and seem to be intimitated, the moment, you realize, that you're gonna see the other side of the story and it's not the next Avengers movie - Black vs. White, Good vs. Evil, etc.
You seemed to be biased the whole time (you knew that you were also gonna play as Abby - in my opinion, a great chance to experience that there are always two sides of the coin) and you just wanted to see your hero from 7 years ago (who, btw also thought that Joels decision was wrong in every way and doesn't seem to be the hero any more and don't have all the cool guns - btw Ellie is still the better character if you play the game in a stealth way) - what would have just been boring, in my point of view.
I did my best to avoid all spoilers, thought that the gameplay was very improved (compared to the First game) and enjoyed the story a lot - in fact, I believe, it's going to be one of the most important games in this console era. 
Nevertheless I totally agree with your GoT verdict.",2020-07-11T01:23:36Z,1,0

I forgave him for that oversight but 6/10 for TLOU 2 has shown how inept this review really is. Example... Ellie clearly has the better weapons. However he rants tired, immature nonsense about Abby's limited, inferior arsenal. 

This work is about 2 daughters fighting over the decisions and mistakes of their fathers. It's about forgiveness of each other and themselves. The development of Dina is beautiful. Tommy has great depth. Abby is a worthy nemesis who I actually care about. Jackson is vibrant, the story is wonderful and beautiful. It is a revenge story... how is that confusing!? The work is written as a homage to Joel. A beautiful eulogy devoted to his redemption. The graphics are amazing, Seattle amazing, Ellie amazing. The NPCs amazing, the AI responsive and amazing. The infected are more menacing. 3 types of human enemies keeps 25 to 30 hours completely fresh and exciting. Even the sex scene is tastefully done. The final message hits home hard if you bring an unbiased mature mind. It's an uncomfortable end that leaves a lasting impression. I am more emotionally attached to this game than any I have ever played before. FFS I've written an essay here due to my love of it. If this game is a 6 then every other game is a 4. 

I have friends who hate games because they see them as children's toys. They have bought PS4s for their kids. They have played this as mature aged couples and are hooked. They love it. That for me is a true endorsement and shows the level of maturity needed to appreciate it. 

I have played through 3 times already and i'm starting a fourth. I played the 1st one 15 times in 7 years. My review of his review is sadly very immature and heavily influenced by the bias of disjointed leaks. He came to the game disappointed before the opening scene.

But still I have to say that you just don't want to understand the ""truth"" of the story or what the writer/director intended the player to feel during that journey. Well it wasn't what YOU wanted Joe. Guess what? Life doesn't go the way you want. sometimes shit happens. Life is not black and white or just the exact road to whatever end you planned. Life takes many turns, as what this game does. It is story that gives us perspective on what is wrong and what is right. we cannot make assumptions on people by their actions. We have to look the more bigger picture here. There are actions and consequences for our actions and with that it brings us the vicious cycle of violence and broken lives. At the end where Ellie plays the Joel's song from the beginning, she can only play it partially so the song sounds broken which is straigthly mirrored to the feeling of Ellie because she's also broken. I rest my case now. Enjoy :D",2020-07-10T21:02:07Z,0,2

This game was a masterpiece. One of the best games ever made. The storyline is incredible and beautifully told. The last of us has always been about survival and vengeance and what you are willing to do in order to achieve either of those. And this game perfectly captures that. You dont have to kill any of those dogs if you dont want to, you can sneak through pretty much all levels of the game. The only dog you have to kill is Alice, kill or be killed.

You as the gamer choose who you kill and who you let live. I found myself on complete revenge mode for the first few fights and was killing everyone. But as the game progressed I started to feel terrible for all the killing, especially the dogs, so decided to sneak through as much as possible.

This game is a monumental achievement and I cant wait to see where they go with the next one. Hopefully it's a prequel so we can get to experience playing as Joel once again.

You don't get to understand the Rattlers very well and in a game that forces the notion that every NPC is a human being, they were treated less than that.

Going into the game I didnt like how sullen or moody Elli was in the intro with Joel and other ppl she knew. The part with Joel felt predictable and didnt seem like he would've put himself in that situation.. After that I was enjoying the game and exploring with Elli and Dina in Seattle. However once I got to Abby I was not enjoying it and was honestly wondering how much longer was left in the game. I never played a game where I wanted it to end and be over. It says a lot when I didnt even start a new game after completing the story. However when I was playing Abby I actually enjoyed her story a little and seeing things from her perspective. In the original I played that game over and over. This one I felt like you did after ending it where Elli is ruined and a broken character from the experiences and the revenge. I know Elli isn't supposed to be exactly the same as her younger self but she shouldn't be this dark and emotionally ruined.,2020-07-10T13:44:09Z,0,1

We learn his story yeah but other than that the story revolves around Ellie. It's all about Ellie. It's always been about Ellie. Now we get a sequel where it kind of switches off from Ellie to someone else people are upset. The one important thing that people are forgetting is that this is a post-apocalyptic world. People will die. Hell Joel cheated death quite a few times in the first game. The fact that he is older and this one and still alive even for the first two hours is a miracle.

Remember Joel did deserve what he got (not in that bad in a shitty gruesome way) but you gotta grow up and realize you gotta take responsibility for your actions. If Joel was alive people would think ah wow they survived just like every generic plot. Naughty dog was thinking out of the box and honestly I think they nailed it. Joel killed abbys loved one, Abby kills him. Ellie KILLS her ‚Äúbf‚Äù , pregnant friend, and her dog. An eye for an eye. I‚Äôm glad Ellie didn‚Äôt kill her. I‚Äôm glad both of em survived in the end. That final act she did was something Joel would of wanted.  (If Joel knew all of what they went through in the game) Joel knew what he got himself into. Actions have consequences. Of course the casual fans were gonna go apeshit when Joel died and immediately say ‚Äúfuck this game why would they do that‚Äù. But honestly you gotta respect naughty dog taking a leap of faith on this one. This is exactly why these games are insanely good. this isn‚Äôt a fairytale where everyone lives happily ever after. Also sure you could predict it was going to be a revenge thing throughout this game. But holy shit the amount of plot twists and oh shit moments made the game so interesting and FUN.

But I thought the longer we played as her the more I could understand her. I will never forgive her for what she did but the thing we need to not forget is that Joel - while he was our and Ellie's hero - he was deeply flawed and not a good person. He did not deserve this kind of death but we don't always get what we want or deserve.

I knew Ellie was going to be older in this game before it was announced, I knew Joel would die in this game especially.  I admire the realistic scenarios and use of realism in this game & it's plot, because that's what the first game consisted of, however regardless I think the developers need to understand that Abby's character was never a character their audience was going to accept, or empathize with, even with the hours of flashbacks and gameplay.  At the end of the day, Abby is still the antagonist, whether the script writers accept it or not.  I enjoyed this game very much, however it was very lackluster.  I think the story was very fitting, I wouldn't be able to see it any other way now.  It portrays realistic/natural human emotion/reaction and storyline in a zombie(clicker) and human rival apocalypse environment, however it's very clear no one was ready to play or wanted a game that had a realistic digressing storyline.",2020-07-10T07:34:18Z,0,0

2. Afraid of the impending economic collapse?
3. Feeling distraught due to the inevitable breakdown of society and eventual civil war?

All these things happening now are but the beginning of sorrows and this is Gods way of giving you a chance to be saved before time runs out!!!

‚ÄúBehold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.‚Äù
‚Ä≠‚Ä≠Revelation‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠3:20‚Ä¨ ‚Ä≠KJV‚Ä¨‚Ä¨

Things won‚Äôt get better, this is an illusion the powers that be have placed upon the world, once the rapture of the church occurs it will get vastly worse, but it‚Äôs not too late for you to be saved even now, all you have to do is:

As a repentant sinner Look into your heart and confess: Dear God I am a wretched sinner, as I repent I put my faith that Jesus is God and that he died buried and resurrected so that his blood can wash away my sins I put my faith in that alone to save me not my good works in Jesus name I pray Amen.

Romans 10:9-10 ""That if you confess with your mouth, ""Jesus is Lord,"" and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.""

Don‚Äôt put your trust in this world, put your trust in God

Joel, joel, joel, joel......every second he is referring to him. Clouded his judgement of the game.
Due to this it seems like Joe didn't give this game a fare review at all.
5-6/10 for this graphic fidelity, sound design, world building, music, voice acting, AI, enhanced game-play with 2 types of styles. nimble assassin type Ellie and brute gunner like Abby.
so this got to the first game ever which has a weight of 4 points for story alone
Things Joe got wrong:
Not Ellie's or Joel's game it's called The Last of Us, not love of a father or daughter,
1. Best Weapons Ellie = butterfly knife and silenced SMG
yet he says Abby gets the best weapons, actually the biggest glaring mistake was that we did not have a big ass combat knife. When WLFs are pretty much military.
Ellie gets the weapons mostly for silent kills and Abby is gun everyone type. Which is what Joe likes in his games and movies, why he thinks Abby has better weapons.
Ellie does pet a dog but when in Jackson and there they keep dogs as pets, where as in most of the game you are combating military trained German Shepards. Even the scars hate the dogs because of this.
2. Pregnancy is seen as a liability, Ellie even says it to Dina, in this world and thus women go out of their way to seem productive and useful. you also hear this from Lev who wanted to be a fighter (being a transgender) but was assigned the role of child bearer for the elders and thus revolted.
3. Owen stops them from killing others as they don't want to be evil like they think Joel is.
4. Most Importantly: 
Ellie wanted her life to mean something and that was taken away by Joel and then she was working to forgive Joel and that was also taken away from her. Her life did not mean anything to her, except revenge or that's what she thought when she kept flashing back to Joel's last moments but that's what she thinks until she has Abby in her hands and realises only in forgiving her she can move on to a next stage of her life and sees Joel in a nicer memory then where she actually tells him that she is going to try to forgive him. Just like Abby did with scars.
4.1. Abby does regret and have negative flashbacks about her father's death even after killing Joel, which she probably thought would go away after killing him, until she goes back to save the Lev and Yara. That's the first time she sees her dad smile in the lab flash back.
5. Ellie moves on stronger than before as she is stronger than not held back by the past, Joel's decisions and is a person who is not making the same mistakes as Joel.
I give him that there seems to be plot armour at certain point and also how lucky they were to find Joel the way they did. Also the I could see better guns on the floor but they would not pick up, additionally how come everyone dies with only 1-2 bullets on them. no one seems to have extra bullets and full mags.
Not that it is perfect and could have been done many other ways but I like that they tried something different, unlike what you see in most games and movies.
i can't understand anyone can objectively give this game anything below an 8/10 based on everything except the story, can be a 8.5-10 depending on how the story choices resonate with you.",2020-07-10T01:34:01Z,1,2

I never thought this game was trying to make us dislike Ellie or Joel, I think it was trying to tell us what pain does to people. What people turn into when someone they love are taken away from them. I get it if you can‚Äôt forgive Abby for killing Joel but this game made me understand why she did it. I had the biggest grin on my face when I murdered all of her friends but over time I grew to rethink everything. All of the actions I did as Ellie are justified to her but when looked at from Abbys side, it‚Äôs sickening. They‚Äôre both the bad guy. And the scenes with Joel and Ellie in the past are some of the most beautiful sections of the game. When Ellie told Joel she would forgive him it broke me.

The fact that these plot points are Druckmann's ideas for the first game that were rejected by more sensible people at Naughty Dog. It pains me that this might be the last game of theirs that I buy. Of all the potential games Naughty Dog could jump the shark on, it had to be this one, didn't it.

The Last of Us 2 - Pushed Agendas.

Edit -
In a world where no one ever admits when they're wrong, especially not on the internet, my following edit may seem strange...

I can see why some people feel so betrayed by this game. I did to. Hence my previous comment. But after reflecting on my experience with the game, I've come to the following conclusion:

We waited impatiently for nearly a decade to see two characters we fell deeply in love in the first game again, only to have one of them unceremoniously taken away from us too soon in the second. But far too often in life, this is the case. We lose people with no real reason or warning, and it leaves a void. 

I think we can all agree we don't play TLOU for the combat or scavenging mechanics. There are plenty of games that do this better. We play for Ellie and Joel. Characters that no other game has managed to do better. We genuinely love them, and so when Joel was taken away so soon it hurt. It hurt a lot. 

That said, I agree that the game was brilliant and that it was a roller coaster of highs and lows culminating in us as the player, essentially having to decide if we can put our own pain and hatred aside, and see things from another's perspective, the way Ellie did. 

Those that can't, and cannot forgive the loss of Joel, find the game to be hollow and meaningless. 

Those that can do so, find the game sanctifying and are rewarded with a sense of peace in Joel's loss. 

And THAT, is great story telling.",2020-07-09T14:41:33Z,9,56

-Ellie leaves Jackson after Joel finally tells her the truth 

-Ellie comes across Abby, maybe she‚Äôs about to be killed by scars and Ellie saves her or Abby saves Ellie.

-Abby brings Ellie back to WLF where maybe Ellie helps out or joins doing missions for them finally finding a community to be apart of since Jackson 

-One assignment leads near to Jackson Ellie and Abby go out there and Abby is injured badly forcing Ellie to bring her to Jackson. By now Abby hasn‚Äôt known about this community or the fact Ellie used to live there


-After Abby is saved recovering in her bed Ellie in the room making sure she‚Äôs okay, Joel walks in after being told Ellie has returned. Some dramatic shit like the music changing and close up on Abbys reaction. 

-Flashback to the scene of young Abby and her Dad, and by now Ellie knows a little bit of how Abbys dad was killed but not the full story on who did it or why. 

-After this I feel like it follows the same path as the original game, Abby eventually kills Joel her revenge getting the best of her and leaves Jackson before getting captured. So Ellie goes out to kill her. Also before all that have the scene where Ellie and Joel reconciling and Ellie not forgiving Joel but wanting to try and put pack together there father daughter relationship. 

-So now after those changes I feel like the game would‚Äôve been a lot better. Players would have a reason to care for Ellie and Abby and the ending would be more justified with Ellie sparing Abby. Again this is just a rough draft and I‚Äôm running on 2 hours of sleep.",2020-07-09T13:51:43Z,3,19

I‚Äôd give it nothing above a 5, yes it looks beautiful and plays well ( mechanics) but nothing is ground breaking.  Also to completely s*it on every beloved character from the first game is just heartbreaking.  Look at Joel, look at Tommy look at Ellie how do they end up??  Abby gets her revenge, gets to beat the crap out of Ellie and throw Tommy off a pier and then gets saved from certain death by Ellie (let‚Äôs not forget Joel saves her ass earlier) and sail off into the sunset with her new buddy.

People are creating their own stories in their minds and believe it has to be that way it goes. But that is not the case. The storyteller tells the story he wants to tell. We can like that or dislike that. But dont say story is weak, characters are weak just because it did not play out the way you wanted it to. Thats ignorant. We have no saying in how the story has to be told and what happens. Where does this attitude come from? People are angry now that Game of Thrones did not end how they wanted to. They are angry how Last Jedi was told. They are angry about this game and are threatening the producers and actors. Are you out of your fucking mind? I am 43 years old, maybe that is the problem, maybe i am to old for this kind of bullshit. I come from a time where i saw a story as what it was. I was able to like it or to dislike it or to discuss it.

The fact that when you switch to Abby you meet all the characters and dogs that you JUST spent like 10 hours killing, was super powerful to me. It left me super bummed out haha. Then the ending was also a huge bummer because I cared about all these characters, and essentially everything that COULD have been destroyed or killed was destroyed or killed.

The entire thing grinds you to a halt the moment that it makes you play Abby AFTER she just killed Joel. 

If you put all of Abby's backstory and journey prior to meeting Joel in DLC (then exclude anything too long about Abby post-killing), then we at least have some time to get used to Abby as someone from the Firefly group that Joel left for shambles. So if you play the DLC, you'll feel empathy for her and if not, hatred....without never playing her. 

Then you can jam in Ellie's backstory with Joel at the start so that the game doesn't just jump into her waking up and greet someone at the door who just go ""hey, heard you went gay back at the bar to another girl?""",2020-07-09T09:49:25Z,0,0

Here it is in a nutshell; Ellie decides to forgive Abby like she wanted to forgive Joel, so she tracks her down to a firefly encampment where they bond together. They have a lesbian interaction and fall in love with each other only for Ellie to sacrifice herself so that the fireflies can develop a cure. Then you play as abby fighting your way back to Jackson to apologize to Tommy and give them all the Cure. The. End.",2020-07-09T05:37:13Z,2,23

So making a new character and explaining her motives through  current events  and flashbacks is playing favorite for that character when you play her for 40 percent of the game? Maybe the reason why Ellie has to kill the dogs is because she is a trespasser to the WLF and they‚Äôve been given orders to kill all trespassers and maybe why Abby gets to play and pet them is because she is apart of the WLF. And the weapons let‚Äôs see Ellie gets A bow, pistol, revolver, pump shotgun, hunting rifle, and a silenced smg and better crafting and upgrades like faster stealth kill me and being able to craft stun and trap bombs. While Abby gets a pistol, hunting pistol, cross bow, semi-auto rifle, flamethrower, and a double barrel shotgun. Nothing really stands out with her upgrades rather than Momentum and being able to move grabbed targets faster. Give me Ellies kit all day.

This game has so many twists and turns and does keep you in suspense because you just don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going to happen next. 

The game was set up so that you hate Abby initially, but so that you could see things from her perspective. So that you can see why she did why she did and how her story and Ellie‚Äôs story are intertwined. 

I feel like the game gives us enough Ellie and Joel flash backs and moments for us to receive closure on their relationship. It‚Äôs up to interpretation, but Ellie never had the chance to fully forgive Joel, and her knowing that Joel died because ultimately he decided to save her must be maddening to her. 

Abby was meant to give you a different perspective of the world. She belonged to the wolves. It showed that she was just this heartless killer, but rather someone overwhelmed by pain and with a heavy heart. The love story between her and owen was set up so that you can understand why it hurt so much to lose owen. It‚Äôs meant for us to get a background on the characters and their relationships. 

The game is brilliant, and the writing in my opinion was phenomenal. Had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. It‚Äôs meant to be a ‚Äúwho‚Äôs really right or wrong‚Äù. 

At the end I grew attracted to Abby and understood why she did what she did. I also understood why Ellie was doing what she was doing. As time goes on maybe people would learn to appreciate this game. 

Amazing gameplay. Fun, exciting and suspenseful. Just like the first one. 10/10. I loved it. I think you should buy it. Don‚Äôt pay attention to the nay sayers.",2020-07-09T03:38:32Z,8,5

I agree though I didnt care at all about these people, the need to find out what happened to ellie was the driving force behind the 2nd half of the game. I'm on my 2nd playthrough now and I just want to skip abbys section if I'm honest.

I think this was a great game but it could've been better focusing on ellie. I like what they did, it wasnt predictable, it's a cold world and when your life gets snuffed out it can be from a mistake, easily made in a sticky situation.

Yes it has pacing issues but I loved this game, an unpopular opinion but i missed the lead up for this game, only finding TLOU1 2 weeks ago so I wasnt waiting 7 years, seeing leaks etc, didnt read any reviews just went in blind and formed my own opinion.. which I think a lot of people arent doing with this game.

And I'm sad for it, because it discourages developers to make narratively complex games in the future. That means, chances for a daring attempt like this are being even more so swallowed up by by-the-numbers-dumbed-down-titles like Fallout 4 that we already see so often. 
You, the player, are *supposed* to hate Abby right off the bat. You were *supposed* to feel exactly as you did; baffled, angry and sad.  You were supposed to feel just as Ellie does in that moment, wher eshe literally loses the things you mentioned; and take on her role. Go on some bloody, bloody revenge, and only gradually get the answers. You were *supposed* to see the effects of both protagonist's [and the world's, for that matter] quest for vengeance; on themselves and each other. But no. You  advocate for the dumbing down. It needs to have the done-and-done story beats that you've seen over and over again. And, judging by the responses below... That is what your audience wants, too.

No. If _someone_ had to die in the sequel, should it have been Joel? Yes. Let's give Joel and Ellie some time together, long enough for Ellie to discover the truth about what happened when she was given over to the Fireflies. Abby takes Joel as a hostage and Joel begs Ellie to run. After arguing with him, she finally relents, but on her way out, she remembers that Joel risked himself to save her from certain death. She turns back and fights her way through to get back to him. She finds Joel in a cell, already brutally killed by W.L.F. in the time it took her to get back to try to save him. Ellie's thirst for revenge is fueled by her inability to save him as he saved her. She mourns as he's discovered, killed off screen and goes on a rampage as she makes her way out of the facility. 
Again, Joel didn't have to die, but if someone did, it had to be him for the sake of the story. Ellie butchers her way out of the facility, Abby finds a trail of her friends and goes to pursue her - leading to a final showdown in which both of them realise that vengeance is cyclical, and as much as each have lost, they both have prospects toward something greater. Both end on a sombre note. 
It didn't have to end with Ellie losing *everything* and Abby basically getting to be a killing machine without a conscience.",2020-07-09T01:38:49Z,1,1

The game like the first one does not have a complicated story but a story that help you relate to the characters and make you feel something for once in a game. We see the changes in both but most from abby who start with getting what she wants and ellie starting her journey to get what she want. One could also say that Ellie only real change is at the end when she is no longer blinded by rage like in the first act.

You ever try writing a compelling story? How dare people shit on the storytelling on display here? I was utterly engrossed throughout and applauded the hard turns the game offered. Top class worldbuilding from the team at Naughty Dog. To lower the score from a 9-10/10 to a 6/10 because its not your typical Marvel storyline feels like YOU are the ones spitting in the developers faces. Thank god I'm mature enough to handle a bit of lesbian/trans themes, small boobs and buff, hairy ladyguns in between all the skullcracking and limb removal. Neil and Naughty Dog made a fearless portrayal of loss, hate and revenge, and unbeknownst to them - the theme bled into the customer reviews. Maybe the hordes of angry gamers was meant to be. Art illicits emotion, and tugging at your hatestrings was most definitely planned by these amazing developers. Now take a step back and applaud some of this monumental achievement, you non-contributing, self-appointed master race peons.",2020-07-09T00:47:46Z,2,3

In my opinion, I  think you get it quite wrong : the game is not manipulative. It's how the character of Abby has been designed. She is really that good girl who loves her dog and her friends (what is so unbelievable about that ?), whose father has been murdered and wants to get revenge. Plain simple. Although Abby makes an awful choice when she tortures and kills Joel. Blinded by fury, Ellie becomes a misguided, evil person who abandons her humanity and destroys everyone in her path. Censorship is the ONLY reason why she doesn't get to slaughter jedi younglings in this game. 
You can't reasonably root for Ellie's crusade. The game isn't about blaming Ellie though : it's an ultra violent story about the pointlessness of violence. Abby and Ellie are proven wrong, for their actions have consequences for people they pretend to care about : Jesse, Norah, Owen, Grizzly, Alice, Mel... All those characters die because of Abby and Ellie's refusal to let go of their hatred. The result is death. And moral death for those who barely survive.",2020-07-09T00:08:47Z,1,4

- Joel and Tommy fighting against the Army who are trying to kill everyone and bombing cities
- Joel and Tommy splitting up 
- Tommys time as a fireflie

- Fireflies fighting the government
- Joel‚Äôs time as a ‚Äûhunter‚Äú
- Joel meeting Bill

Even parts of the story, just not any of the expected beliefs. They had thoughts about what you should feel, and it just doesn't work in the way they wanted. They heavy-handed too much of it, and tried to force feelings that weren't there. 
They wrote a third game in a series of two games without the required context and tried to twist it all into Pulp Fiction. After two playthroughs, I just cannot put it together, Red Dead 2 told the story of Last of Us 2 and did it far better. They wanted a shock beginning too hard, and forced a square peg into a triangle-shaped hole. It just doesn't work in a game that is so well made and deserved so much better.

Dude, I have been watching your videos for years and years and I almost always agree with you. Here, this isn't a game review. This is fangirling about the characters you loved and how this story wasn't what you wanted. We get it. You wanted to play as Joel.

Every point, point-by-point, shows that you entirely misunderstand the game and the intent. They weren't showing Ellie as being bad, through Ellie's whole play through you feel 100% you are the good guy. The difference is the circumstance. Ellie is on a revenge mission. I can point to exactly similar instance of murder-interrupted, plot armor, and introductory of irrelevant and unknown saviors who are then killed in the first game. The point isn't that Abby is good. It is that the only difference between Abby and Ellie is that we met Abby first.

It is impossible not to see that you had already made up your mind before you played the game. Your decision was set by the spoilers, and I get it. That ruined it for you. 

And so Abby gets a semi-auto rifle while Ellie's is bolt action. Ellie gets a silenced submachine gun. And yeah, Abby gets a flamethrower. That's hardly preference. 

You repeatedly say that Tommy didn't do anything after Joel was killed, that he feels off and outside of his character, but that he convinces Ellie to later go after him. Tommy left first. Most of the game play as Ellie you are trying to catch up to him.

I don't know man. On this one I think you were biased as hell. You wanted to play Joel. That taken from you ruined the game for you before it even started. His loss so quickly and suddenly was necessary. They were too careful to fall into a trap, if they hadn't been being chased by the hoard, they wouldn't have made the mistakes that left them entirely alone and surrounded. It also makes sense that they didn't kill Ellie or Tommy since it was Joel, not either of them, that killed Abby's dad and stole the cure. There was no way to know who Ellie was, and Tommy was never in Salt Lake.

Regarding Mel, she didn't choose to go to the front lines. She was ordered by Isaac to the Forward Operating Base as a medic. She wasn't on a patrol, it was supposed to be a normal transport a few miles down the road before the scars hit them. Being a medic serving at a well-defended FOB early in the pregnancy (only a few weeks since the mansion outside jackson) wouldn't have been inherently more dangerous. So i think the ire you expressed was a bit misplaced.

For more than 30 minutes of your review your comments are almost exclusively about how you didn't want to play as Abby. I get that too. There were times, particularly at the introduction of her character where I ALSO reacted that I didn't care and I didn't want to play as her. I also wanted Ellie to get simple revenge. For me, the gameplay and the narrative compelled me forward. Abby's character was fundamentally no different than Ellie's in so many ways. Seeing Abby's friends die at Ellie's hands and then playing through the otherside of the story and seeing the events that led them to where they were was compelling and interesting. Knowing their outcome was a foregone conclusion was painful at times.

When Tommy shows up at Ellie and Dina's I wanted Ellie to just let it go so she could have her family. But over two games they established Ellie as a strong willed self possessed character who does not let things go. The end sequence showing Ellie beginning reconciliation with Joel added even more character motivation. She was supposed to have the opportunity to forgive him. She wanted to find a way for them to be ok again because lets be honest, Joel's actions in Salt Lake were GOING to have consequences. That was ALWAYS going to come back to bite him in the ass. There were ALWAYS going to be other fireflies who knew what happened. Ellie was ALWAYS going to find out the truth, even if she had to take off from Jackson on her own. The opportunity for her to heal the damage to their relationship was ripped away from her. And she felt that loss viscerally. I wanted her to get revenge. And then she failed. And had a family. Ellie killing Abby would have only sent Lev after her. If she had killed them both it wouldn't have filled that loss. The victory wouldn't have even been untainted - Abby had been strung up for weeks. She was emaciated. She was weak. It wasn't a fight between the two of them on even terms with both of them at their best. And yes, Ellie was wounded but that wouldn't have equated the fight. So even the victory wouldn't have been satisfying. She would have killed a wounded and weak, desperate opponent. That would have made Ellie the villain. Letting Abby go was the ONLY redemption.

I think you were just so entrenched in your love for Joel that you missed the entire story.

Abby was by far the most morally justifiable character. Her genius, seemingly lovely father was needlessly murdered for trying to save the world? He didn't want to kill Ellie but it was for the greater good?

Abby goes and kills the only person responsibile and leaves the others alive? A massively unlikeable, selfish Ellie then goes and kills everyone connected to Abby. Ellie literally breaks promises to her pregnant girlfriend and friend when saying shed turn around to go back to Jackson when they found Tommy, only to fuck over Jessie and go on her around to find Abby. Right up until the character switch, I was all for Abby's death, but as soon as we start to bond with Abby, her friends, and her world. I started to empthathise with her much more. Abby even spends her time saving randomers on her travels while Ellie ends up being a bitch to everyone?

Abby even spares her life, TWICE. Nothing can be said about Ellie. 

I agree, I didn't love Joel's death, you're right about the game mechanics not being revolutionary. It definitely did get boring after a while. But I think you went in to this thinking a certain way and didn't want your mind changed. Ellie could have given the world aids and you'd still love her. Why would Abby question her revenge either? Why are you completely okay with Ellie slaughtering innocent lives but when Abby does it it's deplorable?

I know why. It's because we spent nearly half a game with Abby, while we spent a full game, DLC and half of this game with Ellie. I love Ellie and I'm more pissed off about how they've made her into a dick rather than the story as a whole.

I genuinely believe that in time, you'll look back at this game and think different.",2020-07-08T20:20:42Z,0,1

Seems like universality was also another missing piece here--using the fabric of shared experiences to bind us to characters different from ourselves. Would also argue that the very thing that made the game so technically perfect is what makes it also so creatively empty as crunch and pressure to produce was focused in on many of the wrong aspects of the game to the detriment of the narrative. Let's hope this gets devs to strive for better representation of diverse groups through authentic story rather than corporate checklists for marketing because that's what will ultimately help normalize them in the industry.

And then, at the end of the game, have him overpower Abby like the Terminator on a newborn and beat the ever loving shit out of her, culminating in an Aztec sacrifice style execution where he cuts her open using a blade fashioned from the handle of the golf club she used to kill Joel, and then literally rips her heart right out of her chest with his bare hands.

They didnt disrespect Joel, its a normal way to die in the world of tlou and Joel could have  died lots of times befor so as Ellie, he said his name because Joel, Tommy and Abby worked together to escape the Infected, Joel and Tommy trustet them after that so its normal that you say your name to them and you saved Abbys life, no one would think that the person you saved will kill you after that. The Ending is also very good because Ellie realises that there is a cycle of revenge and that she would not be better than Abby. I dont understand all the haters and the people who think that this Story ist burning trash. It has a deep massage and not every game has that. Ellie forgave  Joel at the end, the day after Ellie said to Dina that she wants to look a movie with Joel and they wanted to build their relationship good again but sadly that never happend.

Good art challenges us. Not in terms of difficulty level.... but in ways that are uncomfortable and a lot of times difficult.

Instead, they welcome him but at the same time they're trying to figure out whether he's THE Joel they're looking for or just another guy named Joel. Also here, Joel and his brother are wary and don't really reveal much.

Maybe they tell Joel about their settlement and introduce him the idea of a trade route of sorts between the two settlements

We then have gameplay where Ellie learns that Joel was at another settlement and at that time, Ellie does routine work at their settlement. At some point, Ellie thinks ""what if Joel is in danger there"" but the people around her more or less reassure her that he will cole back. At some places in town, Ellie will reminisce about their first days there, how she met Dina and Jessie, and what happened after she confronted Joel.

Simultaneously, we play as Abby, where we ""bond"" with Joel. At first Joel is very cold and distant, but as the game progresses, he loosens up a bit and starts to talk about a girl he considers his daughter. Here, Abby realizes that maybe there's a possibility this isn't the Joel that killed her dad, that he's just another guy named Joel who has a daughter that he truly loves and cares about. At this point, Abby starts opening about her dad. Bit by bit she tells Joel how he was an amazing dad, how he helped sick people, how he cared about wild animals and more. Here, Joel begins wanting to go home and tells Tommy, Tommy tells Joel that he's staying a bit longer at the settlement to check things out. Abby and her friends become Joel's entourage back to their town, and again they return to the cabin.

At the cabin, Abby finally reveals that her father was unjustly killed by a man even though he only wanted to make a vaccine so their hell could finally end. She ends her statement by saying ""the man who killed my dad... was a man named Joel."" Here Joel goes wide-eyed and Abby immediately asks ""Joel, were you the man who killed my father?"" Here Joel stays silent, and then he reluctantly says ""Yes... it was me."" Here Abby knocks out Joel out of rage and tells the others that he was indeed the Joel that they were looking for.

We then return to Ellie, beginning to ease her fears, and thinking about the prospect of talking to Joel more often. That is, until she learns about the news that Joel stopped reporting back to them. Ellie is distressed and wants to go to the settlement where they went. On the early hours of the next day, Tommy arrives back as if all was well, but when he asks where Joel is, things begin to fall apart.

At this point of the game, Abby and her friends torture Joel for days on end, revealing to him what he has done and the mess he left behind for killing Abby's dad.

At this point, the story mostly follows the game's story, with Tommy leaving early and Ellie following suit.

I don't know, this was just a story line that I thought about. Maybe we intertwine Ellie and Abby's story so both of them are balanced gameplay wise. And instead of a death's door Joel, Ellie finds Joel on his last breath, limbs broken and shit.

This isn't perfect nor good, maybe there's someone out there who made a more convincing story, I'm just saying that this game could've had a better and more comprehensive storyline :P",2020-07-08T15:24:17Z,0,0

Joel passed 5 years in Jackson with Ellie
Living with Ellie probably softened him up and teached him to be more open.
He was getting old , around 55 yo.

TLOU: Joel loses his daughter, builds a relationship with Ellie on the way to finding the fireflie, ending, etc.

TLOU2: Story about Abby in the past, a view from her perspective and actions before the death of her Dad, spend time developing the Group of characters, ends with Abby seeing her Dad dead with fireflies saying it was Joel (Maybe end on a cliff hanger).

TLOU3: Continue on the story switching between perspectives of these main characters that people now know equally well enough to build some connection that it makes the situation difficult on who to choose seeing as they are now well liked and have good reasons for the things that they do. (I Include a TLOU3 because I feel its going to be made anyways.)

Now I understand people will say that many wouldn't play it if the game didn't include Joel and Ellie and it would cause a lot of hate and division but Neil Druckman already expected hate and division and went through with it anyway, but I feel this would've at least Salvaged what you could from Abby because you weren't introduced by having her Kill someone you already like and it wouldn't mess with the narrative of revenge because now there would be no reason for the game to seem biased towards Abby because players already know her, so it would now just create division on who the player prefers or which character is more justified in their actions.",2020-07-08T13:47:03Z,0,0

But before sharing my opinion I'd like to say that I'm not defending this game, just stating the obvious message that most people fail to see.
So, here we go. Joel in the first game was seen as this strong characther, that always dominated the dialogues and on the field. Yes, he was on the brink of death once but overall he was unstoppable.
Most of us were raised on films and games and etc. where the main characther was the coolest and prevailed in the major aspects whilst the other secondary characthers had just to follow him.
In the second game Joel was kind of ""humanized"", he's totally different, emotional and more forthright. He's portraid as a concerned father who can make mistakes.  
TLOU1 Joel wouldn't just casually go on patrols and save people he never heard of. You see now why they call us sexist? They've put Joel on the same level as Ellie :facepalm 
The problem is that the women in this game are no better, it's impossible to symphatize with anybody. 
I presume they wanted to tell a realistic story with tragedy where there's no such thing as closure.
But since the dawn of times, in the legends and in the books the main protagonist is wise, intellegent and strong. We admire them and try to become better persons. That's how we were nurtured.
But what's the message of this game? To make us feel worthless? How can anyone enjoy this game is beyond me.

Now.....the story if they had done things differently may have been likeable or more captivating if we learnt about Abby BEFORE playing as Ellie in the beginning of the game then I think people wouldn‚Äôt argue or get upset playing as Abby, for instance if they built up the tension from the beginning by making the player start off with Abby and continue up to the point with Joel making people understand why she did what she did to Joel then there wouldn‚Äôt be so much loathing to playing as her but because they didn‚Äôt and went with how they did by killing Joel in the most pathetic way it‚Äôs not only disrespectful to those who loved him but it slightly shits on the first game as he went through hell and back as he was shot at, stabbed, impaled and other kinds of painful moments throughout the game all to be killed so weakly it makes those who loved the first game extremely frustrated and angry.

Now Abby....let‚Äôs face it, her character one way or another is just bland and kinda boring, sure you sympathise with what happened to her (although for many it was disgust because you had to play as her) but outside of her revenge plot she‚Äôs just a ehhh kind of character, like I really really tried to like her character but I just felt she wasn‚Äôt interesting or in the very least put there to be a strong independent woman who is tougher then the men and I‚Äôm all for a a powerful female lead, but when you make her generic and bland with little to no interesting traits other then ‚ÄúROAAAR I HAVE TO KILL JOEL‚Äù and ‚ÄúI Need to rejoin the fireflies‚Äù it‚Äôs just meh writing, which by the way I can‚Äôt be the only one who thought the whole ‚Äúrevenge‚Äù plot idea felt weak and uninteresting like I get it for Ellie but the execution felt so off.

If I‚Äôm being real the leaks did many people favours on what the story would be like, though I feel for those who worked on the game as they did make it look gorgeous and so artistically detailed I loved that but with the uninteresting characters and story it fell apart which is sad as stories like this are supposed to entice you to play and look forward to more but for me I didn‚Äôt get that, like I didn‚Äôt have a issue with Ellie being gay as that was established in the last game in the DLC which everyone praised even me, I expected Joel to die as it‚Äôs rare for the protagonist from the first game to survive the sequel but the execution was terrible and honestly I just found it boring  which you don‚Äôt want people to feel playing it, I understand why many did love the game and fine if you get a connection to it then I respect that but I just feel this is extremely detached from how the first game made you feel playing it and I now worry if they do make a 3rd it‚Äôs going to have that feel unless they think about the plot carefully.",2020-07-08T12:55:06Z,0,1

So today we have games like Death Stranding and The Last of Us Part 2. You know what I discovered, works of art are not fun. I don't want a cheap moral lesson in games. I want to be the hero. I want to be the main character. I want to immerse myself in a reality different from real life, an exciting reality that makes me dream. I don't want nightmares, sadness, bad anxieties, monotony, for that I already have real life. Games and anime were my last strongholds of cultural fun. They were different from films, series and dramatic novels. Now I only have a few anime left. When you play a game like The Last of Us part 2 and you only have negative feelings, whose characters you don't care about and remember, where you would like to see, again, Tess, Bill, Henry, Sam and even David, something came out wrong. I don't know what the hell is going on in Neil Druckman and Hideo Kojima's mind, but one thing I tell you, you are working in the wrong business. They started very well but you were influenced by other media and the wrong audience.",2020-07-08T12:16:29Z,0,5

Abby wanted to took revenge because of her father and Ellie for Joel there is no good guy. Ellie took so much from Abby and i understand why but still the choices for Ellie does make a person angry so the story is for me pretty good and for me understandable and graphics and such are perfect.

It was just that bit too much of trying to teach us a lesson, at the end the whole journey felt worthless. I don't think it deserves the levels of vitriol it's received. The cast definitely don't.

Then Ellie gets revenge even though she knows exactly why Abby herself got revenge. In getting revenge she kills Abby‚Äôs closest friends.

I liked how Hajime develop his story from just ""straight outta avenge your loved ones"" to be complicated things with more revelations throughout the story, and not even once (i think) let down his readers with how the character act and his story choices.

You can tell that Revenge is Bad, it has it's consequence but to forgive it is a really hard thing to do, it was a very long journey and Hajime can perfectly potrait them.

...
What I'm getting at here is the irony of this situation. Laura Bailey and Troy Baker have now worked together in 2 recent games where Laura's character kills Troy's. Not to mention Laura's said characters were both not well liked by most players. I just thought this was hilarious and sad at the same time when I figured this all out.",2020-07-08T06:26:56Z,1,0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-sTlYUeT8o,The Last of Us Part II - Angry Review,2020-07-02T02:32:07Z,@isaiahwelch8066,"My issue is that Neil Fuckmann has never read any _actual,_ realistic post-apocalyptic sci-fi. If he had, the situation that resulted in Joel's death _should never have happened._ Here is why:
Basically, first off, Abby and Crew _could not have_ gotten to Jackson from Seattle, _in the dead of winter._ Movement is all but impossible, unless the number of people is smaller than 3 -- yet Abby moves almost _a dozen_ people through the Rockies, during the winter, and _during a blizzard?_ GTFO. I call BS, because anyone who lives in the mountains knows, movement when the weather is good is hard -- movement during the winter harder, if not impossible. Add into this that they didn't use trucks, they used _horses._ Not even horses are able to traverse snow-covered mountain terrain, when blizzards, drifting, and high amounts of snow have fallen -- we're not talking inches, we're talking _feet of snow._

Second, Abby would have had to be well-supplied and provisioned -- and this still runs counter to the number of people that were at the mansion. Most people need 2,000-3,000 calories per day to function properly. That caloric intake goes up in winter because the human body has to maintain homeostasis -- i.e., body heat. And having almost a dozen mouths to feed would result in hundreds of pounds of food for the party -- which means Fuckmann didnt even consider the logistics for the story.

Next, tactics. It's hard for one person to move around in the mountains during the winter, and be stealthy. You're telling me that Abby not only could move her party through the mountains, but that _nobody tracked them at all?_ Especially near Jackson? Again, GTFO, especially when you add in horses to the mix. Relatedly, given that the deeper into the mountains you go, the harder shelter is to find -- and especially shelter _for a dozen people._ And add to that the fact that Abby had no idea where Jackson actually was, other than ""it's out in western Wyoming."" Her and her party would have died of starvation long before finding Jackson (see the Donner party). And even if she did somehow find Jackson, she and her party would not have had the strength to scout, let alone observe Jackson, for any length of time (speaking about Jackson patrols).

Basically, Neil Fuckmann wanted Joel dead, _no matter what._ I mean, sure, George R. R. Martin killed off characters in Game of Thrones -- but those killings made sense and had actual reasons attached to them. Not so in TLOU 2. Neil Fuckmann wanted Joel dead, no matter the cost, just so he could seem cool in the eyes of SJCs everywhere (SJC: Social Justice Cultist), and so he could be seen as ""being Woke."" But as we all know, if you  ""get Woke,"" you ""get Broke.""

Fans of the game wanted an _epic story,_ not to have PC feminazi trans-garbage Marxism forced down their throats. And Fuckmann and ND wonder why their _wunderkind_ highly-hyped sequel did so shitty? Because Neil Fuckmann failed at the one job he had: To tell an epic story, involving legendary characters.",2020-07-08T06:19:04Z,13,58

This game only had one theme and is Joel's deserved Torment and punishment, and by extent, all the people that agreed with the ending in the first game.

See, all the game is there to show Joel (and by extension the player) two things: a damaged and broken Ellie that you desire died at the first game and what Joel deserved: dying and being spit in a mob, you stole a chance for salvation for the world, the world can and will remove you from it.

They make this game with only that in mind, to show how everyone that was ""save Ellie"" while playing the first one gets punished for that thought.
The story doesn't matter because is only there to link somehow those two things that they care about.

Play the first half of the game as Ellie with Joel alive, only Joel slowly degrades as a man over the things he did at the end of the last game (sacrificing the entirety of humanity for one person (potentially) has to weigh on a good man), causing friction with Ellie who finds she can't also entirely forgive him (even mechanically, you can have Joel follow Ellie as Joel slowly slips up more and more and becomes more of a liability then an aid). She gets stronger while Joel grows weaker forcing them apart; while Abby builds up to kill Joel for what he did and her involvement in it.

Then Joel's death happens at the end, not because Abby kills him, but because he wants to die (that's why he's so trusting) which abby realizes and ""forgives"" him (or better said she realizes the punishment has already happened) and doesn't kill him; yet the situation they're in which Abby is responsible for putting the three of them in ends up in Joel's death anyway (Joel sacrifices himself to get Abby and Ellie out the way of a clicker horde or something else unanticipated, leading to a final redemption for Joel). Then game 3 could be about Ellie having to deal with issues left unresolved by Joel's death and going after Abby after she decides to blame her for it. Then 3 ends like 2 did; Ellie forgives Abby after she's gone through her own doubts about what she did along the way to Joel's death and Ellie realizing that basically, shit happens and making things worse will not make things better. 

Or hell, make a few extra missions in the early open world section of the game with joel, rearrange the story (3H with Joel, 6H with abby, 6H with Ellie) and sell it that way like DLC as sort of an ""alternative universe"" story. Maybe not even sell it If Naughty Dog wants their fans back and wants to pull a No Mans Sky. Which'd certainly be easier to do for them then it was for Hello games as it'd basically just be 1 content update for the story instead of 10 for a persistent world game.

But as depressing as this world is, i've given up hope for ""Yeah, we where wrong and we're sorry, we're going to spend money to fix this immediately because fans actually matter to us"" long long ago. What i expect their next board meeting to say?

""Good going Druckman, now we need to spend a few million more on advertising on the next game. You think these PPP loans grow on trees? I'm running out of $100 bills to wipe my ass with here"".",2020-07-08T02:39:38Z,0,0

The game was for naught, it acomplished nothing. Neil promised us that if there ever was a sequel, that it would be because there was a story worth telling. Seven years later here we are and he delivered a cliched story with a cliche message about how violence breads more violence expecting us to react like ""OH MY GOD, THAT IS SO GROUND BREAKING, I CAN¬¥T BELIEVE I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT!"". The worst of it, is that this game ruins the first¬¥s ending, where it was up to the player to choose if what Joel did was right or wrong, that was one of the better aspects of the game, it didn¬¥t meddle with your morality, while this one does, and pretty much says ""FUCK YOU, JOEL WAS WRONG"".

The whole point of the story is to make you realize that Joel was a VILLAIN. Ellie and Abby are mirrors of each other having the ruthlessly kill, and realizing their heartless vengeance left them both with almost nothing. Sadness and death. I do think they could have written the story in a different order without all those flashbacks. Chronologically it would have been better. But imagine if the first game was about Abby and her dad. You‚Äôd see the villainy of Joel, and you‚Äôd hate to see him kill Abby‚Äôs dad and be all butt hurt about THAT. Come on now.

I think it was never possible to achieve the same emotional gravity as the first game, or the same quality either. It couldve been better but the reason why it‚Äôs so bad to everyone is, well a lot of reasons probably, but IMO it‚Äôs because of everyone holding this game to the same standards as the first. Lots of times there was WAY to much jumping around, and the writing could have been better, tremendously so, is it a 10/10? Absolutely not, does it deserve the amount of hate and death threats devs and actors are getting? Also absolutely not. I liked a lot about the game, I also believe that people are crying because it‚Äôs not the story THEY wanted vs the game naughty dog wanted to create, that‚Äôs the problem. I liked the game, I was fine with playing as abby and honestly I felt like Ellie‚Äôs revenge quest was so unjust. Abby showed time and time again she was the bigger person , and I viewed Ellie as still a child that in the end finally grew up and accepted the reason for abbys revenge which was SO MUCH MORE JUSTIFIED.

Abby is the equivalent of Locke but much.. much worse..

I do think a game with this direction if done properly would be better than a 24/7 joel and ellie game done properly. Maybe if abby was a hospital worker and lost more than just her dad, or there was evidence abbys dad died a slow death, or anything that would make us sympathise in the end with abby for beating someone to death with a golf club. Naughty dog should have tried to imply that evil acts arent necessarily done for evil purposes (joel saving ellie, abby killing joel, ellie torturing leah) but that those who are badly affected by it will automatically assume an evil reason (if you saw someone you knew tortuerd) (ellie was gonna go after abby even though she probably knew she would have done the same thing as abby) and that it matters on how you're personally affected by the situation.  Otherwise, naughty dog should have just had joel shot. Letting ellie go felt a bit unrealistic too after she just killed owen and mel too.


Also a sad ending could have been good, where Ellie kills comes back to find dina and jj killed and kills herself out of guilt and the recurring ptsd from letting abby live.",2020-07-07T21:55:41Z,0,0

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-sTlYUeT8o,The Last of Us Part II - Angry Review,2020-07-02T02:32:07Z,@ConnorJara,"The last of us was never a focus on characters, rather of multiple scraps of humanity finding meaning and surviving in their new world. We get to experience this on a more granular scale with  individual characters whom we relate and grow to understand. Most of the hate this game is receiving is based off the strong characters of Joel and Ellie from part 1 and the expectation there narrative would be further explored. 

Joel's story ended in part 1, there was not much else to tell as he was presented with the opportunity to save his adopted daughter and overcome a similar event that had haunted him and defined him in post infection America. He took it and succeeded and anyone with him on his journey 100% understood his decision for doing so. Part 2 wasnt perfect but it's by no means straying from the themes the first instilled. It's a good sequel, I will agree the narrative could have been adjusted to be more impactful or adjusted to not turn everyone immediately against Abby. If anyone went in expecting Joel and Ellie part 2, they should rethink on what the themes are of this game.

 In Part 2 we saw multiple microcosms of society and there weaknesses / Strengths in coping with the new world. Part 2 shows us the death throes of 2 factions long feud coming to a close. The WLF - A Xenophobic military faction rooted in an endless war where both participants have no memory of what started it. The Seraphites - A cult like tribal society rooted in the more perverse and unquestioning devotion to faith and its practices leading to the cleansing of non-believers. Jacksonites and there more secluded yet cautious lifestyle where society lives in a limited yet prosperous way. The rattlers - a faction displaying what pits of hell humanity can crawl and survive.

 Overall, expectations can end something before it begins; I beleive this to be a perfect example of expectations killing a game. Time will be kinder to the Last of Us Part 2.",2020-07-07T21:44:57Z,0,1

And yes, Ellie is not the same as she was in the first game, she is broken in the end, this world breaks people, even the ones who was once good and innocent. And killing Joel of early was surprising and shocking too, we loved these moments in Game of Thrones, so why not here, I simply don‚Äôt get the critique? And there were some awesome flashbacks between Joel and Ellie to make up for the fact that this was not Joel and Ellies story any more. That was told in the first chapter. This was Ellie and Abbys story, and I found that to be a good choice. The story of Abby, and why she killed Joel was a great way to connect this story with the ending of the first. I didn‚Äôt have a problem with it, and got to care a great deal for Abby actually. SO much so that I didn‚Äôt want either her or Ellie to die in the end, and that made certain scenes nervewreaking as hell to say the least. The details in the game were out of this world, the physical changes to the looks of Ellie and Abby as they both progress through the story, you see how they move from good looking women to destroyed and broken down human beings until they almost animal like face each other in the end. Just look at how Abby goes from a normal build kid, to a muscular beast and in the end having lost most of it, and Ellie looking like skin and bones missing her fingers, it‚Äôs brutal, just like it would be in real life.

I personally think that there would have been so much more impact if Part 2 was JUST Abby's story starting from the end of The Last of Us and using the flashbacks to further establish the relationship between Abby and her father and also the relationship with Abby and her crew. THEN if there was a part 3 you can put the two women in conflict with one another... but i guess that would make sense and we cant have that... or maybe im just being too reasonable?

I believe that all characters were justified in the paths they took, and while the ending made me feel ""well wtf this was all for nothing"" that is the point. Ellies PTSD tore her apart and she felt the only way out was to kill Abby, only to at the last second realize that just wasn't going to happen. Tommy did have his reasons to want Ellie to chase after Abby as well, it's way more personal than it was to him than before. Abby stole his eyesight and he now has a limp, and in the long term esentially robbed him of his relationship as well because once he started harboring that anger towards her Maria wanted nothing to do with him. Abby was justified in her revenge quest, and while I wasn't the biggest fan of her character, I at least saw her point of view. I'm not saying it's better than the first, but it definitely deserves more respect than its getting. The gameplay, visuals and acting are all phenomenal. Everyone complains about how Ellie seems so grey in comparison to the first game, and again, THATS THE POINT. she's coping with the fact that Joel lied to her, and that as she put it her ""life could have mattered"" and as soon as she tries to fix the relationship with Joel, it's robbed from her. Of fucking course she's not gonna be like the 14 year old from the first game and it would be stupid if she did act that way. Rant over.",2020-07-07T19:30:12Z,0,2

so this is what the should've be imo. PART2, like i said before, should've been about Abby, Yara, and Lev. WLF and the Scars. no people from Jackson involved whatsoever. i really don't mind if they decided to change the main character, no Ellie or Joel. in a matter of fact, it would be much cooler to see these survivor outisde of Boston, Jackson, and other places from the first game.

i also been thinking this. they should've change the main character in each TLoU game. each TLoU has their own main protag, and all of them does not have anything to do with previous main protag. i personally would love to see this kind of TLoU game",2020-07-07T18:35:21Z,0,0

Her head is so small and the rest of her proportions are all wrong.  Her sternum size, shoulder width, and waist size don't match what how she's proportioned in the ""4 years earlier"" segment.  Women have muscles sure, but they most often retain the frame and curves of a female (unless they abuse drugs to get unnaturally grown muscle which this world doesn't have steroids, estrogen blocker, etc.).  She can have muscles, but when she's built more like a man than the actual men are, it's REALLY distracting for me, whenever I look at ""her"", to not feel like this is contrived (considering how realistic the game is supposed to be) or that the character was originally meant to be trans (which I think was the case and would have made more sense, honestly).

Abby wants to get revenge because Joel killed his father, but...
1) Joel killed his father because he confronted him when he was about to kill an unconscious 14 year old performing brain surgery on her without consent. Abby knows all of that.
2) Joel killed Abby's father quick. Abby is a torturer and made sure it was a painful and slow death.
3) Joel killed Abby's father because he tried to stop him saving Ellie and threatened him with a scalpel. It was a functional kill. Abby travelled specifically to kill Joel and enjoyed it.
4) Joel had to face an army all alone to rescue Ellie. Abby brought a platoon to find and kill Joel and made them participate in the torturing.
5) Abby says she's pissed because Tommy and Ellie killed her ""friends"" but later she doesn't have a problem killing Wolfs she knows personally to protect a kid she just met.
6) Abby didn't give a shit about her ""friends"" when she dragged them accross the country to kill Joel and wanted them to risk their lives in a suicidal mission attacking the city of Jackson.
7) Abby called Owen (the man she allegedly loved) a traitor and was disgusted with him because he didn't want to go on a suicide mission knowing his girflriend was pregnant.
8) Abby was about to knowingly execute a pregnant woman and only stopped because the kid she just met told her to stop.
9) Back at the WLF base, Abby doesn't show any emotion around Scars being killed and tortured until she meets the trans kid and his sister. Then magically feels more attached to them than people she has known for years.
10) Abby never shows any remorse for killing Joel the way she did or the harm that she brought to anybody close to her with her selfish and shitty actions. In fact, for all her obsession with her father's death, Abby doesn't even want to pursue his legacy and try to find a cure or restore the Fireflies. She even tells Owen she doesn't give a fuck about the Fireflies and would run in the opposite direction if they still existed.
The fact Naughty Dog expected the players to feel empathy for Abby after all of that baffles me. She is a disgusting human being they try to redeem via plot device with her unjustified and magical unbreakable bond with Lev. Abby doesn't reject or regret violence once until the last scene of TLOU2 and even then she is easily convinced to fight to death. Then she gets spared and we are supposed to feel pitty for her. Breaking the cycle of violence my ass! The whole game revolves around this idea that revenge is bad and doesn't achieve anything good but at the same time TLOU2 wants you to feel empathy towads Abby's revenge and then justifies violence when Lev kills his intolerant mother (""you did nothing wrong, you protected yourself"") or Abby kills literally everybody she crosses with out of ""love"" for Lev and in her effort to ""protect"" him. Which is exactly the same thing Joel did for Ellie in the original TLOU and gets punished and demonized for in TLOU2. Bullshit!

The best advice I or anyone can give to any and everyone:  Each and every person in the world is entitled to their opinion. You don't have to like it, but you should RESPECT it, even if you think it's wrong and/or harmful. Forcing your own opinion on another is worse than the other person's opinion.

You will dismiss this as unfounded criticism because I do not intend to go into specifics. But you did not get the game. The sequel was clearly set up from the last moment of part one. The core issue here is, that you don't want video games to change. You just did not get this one. You went in with expectations muddled by those leaks and you got what you were set out to get from it. You don't understand what the writer tried to get across. I'm sorry but I fear you're not as clever as you think you are. I'm disappointed. Not by the controversial score but by your lack of intellect.

You take a realistic protective father figure and tear him down, for zero reason story wise other than just to hurt the image of masculinity.

On top of that you reduce the gameplay/story for the character who was a strong female icon in the game.

Part 3 the main character will be some Handicapped Blasian Muslim Woman who identifies as a man that is gay. I'm sure I missed a victim group somewhere in there. 

Just remember that eventually this virtue signaling will alienate you from the rest of society which lives in reality, if it hasn't already. I just pity these people, they will grow old and miserable because they weren't able to project their insanity onto the rest of society. The few who walk away from their hypocritical hateful rhetoric will be much more successful in life because they will able handle the real world and stop blaming everyone else for their shortcomings.

Also people getting mad for playing Abby. Personally I loved playing as Abby because you got to SEE the OTHER side of humanity ""Ex fireflies"" now becoming WOLF. And Abby wanting revenge on Joel for killing her father. 
I enjoyed the game. I never predicted what was going to happen, I knew it was going to be an revenge plot, but both sides were revenge plots. I enjoyed the game. I give it a 8/10 If they gave Joel a better death it would be a 10/10 easy, because I didn't cry at all in Last of Us 2, I didn't feel THAT much love for Ellie and Joel like the first, but I am sure the 3rd series will be great. I am sure Naughty dog will take these ""critics"" to what people ""think"" are wrong or rushed in this game and will do a ""better job""  AngryJoe is way to biased and to intense in his reviews lately. The game does NOT release a 6/10 that is lowballing what most companies would destroy. Naughty Dog did a good job with this game 8/10 easy. 
If they made the Ellie and Joel scenes better and made you ""fall in love"" with both of those characters then Joels death would be more sadder. But it is what it is. I enjoyed it. Playing as Ellie and Abby. Like I said. AJ is a bitch for ""hating"" the game because you play as abby  because she was the one who killed Abby. So end of it all. 8/10.

I don't even have the energy to be angry anymore...after everything we've been through with these characters, they deserved so much better. Joel deserved better. Ellie deserved better. We, the fans, deserved better. This kind of treatment of iconic characters (I bought a ps3 literally just to play 'the last of us' years ago) and the state of video games as a whole today turns me off of the medium completely.
As a child I used video games to escape my reality and go to a fantasy where I was safe from the real world, and now, decades later, I find online casinos, predatory 'macro' transactions, 'time savers', online only, gender identity politics, political agendas, and pc culture in my fantasy world. It's just not fair.
We have amoral people, immorally preaching morality at us.

For starters the game is amazing. The story is amazing and the characters and character development was really good as always. 
So first of all. 
Death of Joel was supposed to feel bad and I mean disgusting and uncomfortable. It took me by surprise and I,  of course was sad and pissed with Abby and wanted to take revenge. I didn't think the plot was predictable in fact after I got to Abby and played as her I didn't know what to expect after. They didn't disrespect the characters at all. Flashbacks showed how good relationship Ellie and Joel had. Joel's character grew a lot in this game and Ellie's too. I actually now love Ellie's character more. She's so badass now! 

I do agree on the gameplay of Abby it was really fun and it had one of the most thrilled and scary fights of the game I believe they did that on purpose to make us like Abby but that was it, to be honest I love playing as Ellie and Abby but I like more Ellie's gameplay in the end. I can't believe that you say that Abby has more attention like really? The game focuses more on Ellie wtf and the arsenal and equipment are more diverse for Ellie! Lmao! Ellie had Molotovs, Smoke bombs and Trip Mines! I love Trip Mines! Abby, what did she have? Ohh yes Pipe bombs that's it lol Ellie had the submachine gun and the explosive Arrows which wins to the incinerary shells and Flamethrower any day! While I don't agree on your other statements I respect them but man come on Ellie had a better Arsenal, a lot more ways to kill and go through the game more entertaining! She can kill clickers! 

About the dog part well it doesn't make a difference for me and yeah it's fucked up to kill dogs with Ellie but I ended up hating dogs on this game so annoying lol about the sex scene it was a bit of extreme but I didn't put much attention to it. I personally like Abby's and Owen's romance, I like Owen's character a lot.

I guess you didn't like the story of the game and it's ok. I loved it and what I got from it is that the story tells you that there's no good or bad and it is all about perspectives. Playing as Abby wasn't in no way diminishing Ellie's character, they were trying to make us like her or not even that just understood her actions. I ended up empathizing with her. Even though she killed Joel she had her reasons and it was because Joel kill her Dad. Ellie was like Abby when she first look for Joel to kill him but Ellie realized that her seek of revenge broke her. At the end Ellie spared Abby by forgiving her but she also forgives Joel for what he did. I really didn't expect the ending and at first I felt uneasy but after digesting the story I realize that Ellie have grown and I believe she wll go back to Jackson to Dina and JJ or at least try to get to her. Abby in the other hand did feel bad and empty after killing Joel because she realize that his father didn't come back so she seek redemption and she found it on Lev. Abby and Lev reminded me so much to Joel and Ellie and that's what made me like her character. I even liked Manny. 

I really like that they made us play both perspectives, it feels like a unique experience because there's really no villain on the game, there were just perspectives. Ellie's and Abby's perspectives.",2020-07-07T10:02:44Z,3,2

Let me start with saying I think 6/10 is a fair score considering you did not like the story (or actually hated it). I wanted to point out some things though.
- I believe the point about the game being manipulative because it is trying to make you like Abby is missed. You do get to know her side of the story but whether you will grow to like that character or not is fully up to you. I think most of the people who play the game start off hating Abby (obviously) and as you go through the story that feeling transforms (and it may transform into different things for different people) or it just stays the same. At no point did I have the impression that the game is trying to manipulate me into liking Abby.
- I do not believe in any review you can speak on behalf of (all of) ""us"" and ""everyone"", yet at least twice you do exactly that
- In my opinion critique towards N. Druckmann in this review becomes too personal and actually I find it disrespectful
- Last but not least - Molotovs are not part of Abby's equipment in the game :)",2020-07-07T09:27:59Z,0,0

Playing as Abby gives a much more deep insight into why the fuck she brutally kills Joel. Initially I was like wtf?! Why did she do that? But once I played as Abby, I really understood why she did what she did. In a lot of ways, she is like Ellie (apart from the Rhonda rouzy physique) in the sense that she lost her father figure at a young age and set out on a quest of revenge. Unlike Ellie however, she does not hesitate with killing Joel and moves on after meeting lev becoming like a sister figure in a way making up for the death of her dad by caring for someone else. Ellie on the other hand cannot bring herself to kill Abby not because she‚Äôs pussy. Before Joel‚Äôs death, Ellie pretty much stopped talking to Joel cause of the whole cure thing and ‚Äúkilled‚Äù her relationship with him. She couldn‚Äôt kill Abby because, in my opinion, it would remind her of what she did to Joel and also after seeing Abby‚Äôs connection to Lev, she would not want to do the same thing to Lev as what was done to her. The whole story is not driven by solely by revenge (from Ellie‚Äôs POV) but rather by Ellie‚Äôs absolute regret of what she did to Joel and so, in her mind, she tries to avenge Joel hoping that it would make up for the relationship she lost. 
And for those who say that Joel‚Äôs death was abrupt etc., remember that this world is a savage world. I mean we have the scars who literally spill peoples guts before hanging them. Do you expect Joel to die in the sunset while Ellie and everyone sits around him? No. His death was exactly the way it should be in this gruesome world. I know I sound like some hippie arts student but man that‚Äôs what I thought. Not to mention how god damn beautiful the game feels. Anyway, that‚Äôs just my 2 cents.

They present you with little elaborate characters, flat and without credible attitudes, in the end, the Studio manages to destroy Ellie, Joe and Tommy, who do not behave rationally and do not respect the personalities established in the first installment.
Here, in her attempt to shake the audience, Abby is now with us for long hours, Joel's substitute, but written in such a disappointing and simple way that the vast majority of consumers in this beloved franchise would not care or will miss",2020-07-07T07:38:47Z,0,0

Her past could have been slowly revealed. Ellie would discover through Abby how her father was killed, and that Joel lied to her. This would cause a rift between her and Joel, and conflict would erupt between the three of them when it‚Äôs revealed to Abby that Joel killed the Fireflies to save Ellie. In the end, I wouldn‚Äôt mind Abby killing off a bunch of their friends, but ultimately failing to get revenge.

I mean, they could have created a compelling, suspenseful story of cat & mouse; slow-building, more linear, but at least more coherent (without all the perspective switching and flashbacks).
What the storytellers did wrong was drop a new character in with no backstory set up and had them murder the fan-favorite protagonist in the first chapter, which felt like shock value considering a motive was not explained; then the game flailed about for hours as it switched perspectives, and ultimately created a messy, convoluted timeline. And as others have said, which I agree with: it teaches that revenge is bad, but it's so dark and depressing I can't imagine why anyone would want to gruel through it more than once.

Things Ellie has that are better:
- Infinite use dagger > Shivs that break
- Rifle witch upgrades single bullet damage > Rifle which adds burst fire so you need to spend more ammo to deal more damage
- Shotgun w/ 4(6) shell capacity > Shotgun w/ 2 shell capacity
- Stun/Smoke grenades > ???
- Proximity mines > ???
- Molotovs that explode on impact > Pipe bombs with a timed fuse
(In practice I didn't see much difference here, but theoretically enemies could run away from a timed fuse)

Things Abby has that are better:
- Pistol that one-shots most enemies in the chest > Revolver that only one-shots in the head
- Flamethrower > ???

The unfortunate truth this game faces us with is that the choices we make not only affect ourselves but the people we care about and the world we live in. Don't focus on the game trying to manipulate the player, just strap for the ride. The world is not black and white. Just try to learn something from it, and it's a pretty good game.",2020-07-07T02:37:34Z,5,1

It did drag on and on, they absolutely didn't need to whole story of going to the Scar island. It was cinematic and all, but would of been better as a ¬£14.99 standalone like Left Behind.

I thought playing/seeing things from Abbey's side was good, it just went on and on, but you appreciate how Joel really was the bad guy. As much as we all love his character, he was a baddie. As such I empathized with Abbey, as I got to know her story more I understood her killing Joel and don't hate her for it. 

As for people not understanding Ellie letting her live at the end, I see it as her coming to the realization they are really two sides of the same coin, and it dawning on Ellie herself that she is the baddie now.

Just my thoughts. Great game, not as good at the first, and TOO DAMN LONG!",2020-07-07T02:37:31Z,0,0

I appreciate the long and detailed review of this, as I wasn't really satisfied with how the first one ended and wanted to see if anything was added to the story of Ellie and Joel.  Looks like nothing of value was? So I guess I'll be watching a let's play or summaries of the game instead.  That's unfortunate.

You can't complain that a game is predictable when you've already read the entire plot before playing. He really does have his mind made up before he even picks up the controller. I can see why so many people hate it, and I 100% agree that killing Joel that early was a really dumb move, but isnt Joe the one that always complains that every game does the same shit, that it's always good guy beats bad guy, doesn't it help gaming a fuck ton to have games start to move in directions that are new and less expected?

It's a soap opera not a action/adventure game. I didn't want to play as abby. At the start you kill abbie and everyone lives happy ever after. And they didn't even finish the story. It ended on a low note. They should have done the game with Ellie doing over 60% of the game. And going out to finish the job from the first game to get to the fireflys and give them the cure. And teaming up with aby to fight the bad guys and the infected. Ultamitly ending with aby finishing the game by riding the world of the dead and forgiving Joel just like when Ellie let aby live. It was a great game idea. But poorly executed. And I am not going to do a new game plus to go through the drama again. And I don't want to play a last of us 3 if they make one.

But becauseit got some progressive characters, the gaming journalists are bending over backwards to sing praises to this game and the honest consumers, who dosen't want to dance to this tune gets yelled at and attacked ... I can't put my finger on it, but it feels kinda like a deja vu, like we experienced something similar to this, before. As you said yourself, there is no problem in telling a new story, even one that takes some risks and even letting beloved characters die, BUT you have to respect the audience and what they love and care about, and you have to respect the characters that your audience loves, even if they belong to you. Society-wise we seem to be at a tipping point, were all this progessiv stuff is going way over the head of the normal folks, who are just not too interested and/or invested in this and just want to kick back and enjoy a few hours of gaming. Back in the days, politics in media used to be more subtle and allowed people from all walks of life to enjoy a movie or show together, no matter whatever their political outlook might have been. And it is entirely in everyones right to vote with their wallets, today maybe more then ever. But everytime one of this projects falls, WE get yelled at because we didn't like it and didn't threw our money at it. I am not saying that this topics shouldn't be talked about or got a segment in gaming, but nowadays, this is never subtle, and never done as garnish, but it gets mixed in with the whole dish, and you got to eat it up and say thank you. Well whatever, I am ranting too much by now :P But Angry Joe, over the years you have stayed impartial and you have stayed angry, ie passionate, and your view on this mirrors the one I got, and probably of many of your audience. This situation here shows how important people like you are, and for this I give you my 10/10 bad ass badge of approval!",2020-07-06T21:40:21Z,0,0

You can like him all you want, but he's obviously a very troubled dude who has done some really harsh shit in the world he lives in. Yes, we were all pumped to kill those doctors and save Ellie at the end of the game, but he took the choice away from her and lied to her about it for years. He saved her for his own redemption, while taking away a chance for the entire race to get redemption. 

I just don't understand everyone's frustrations with fictional works when they kill off a main character. Joel got what was coming to him. His redemption arc doesn't clear him of past sins. Sorry you wanted ""Joel and Ellie the buddy cop movie the game"".",2020-07-06T21:12:40Z,3,3

Many will disagree and that‚Äôs ok, just wanted to give my observations and connections, as this story is more of an internal journey of the two characters than anything. I overall enjoyed the game. A lot. And I adore the first one. It is better than part 2 story wise. Part 2 takes a stance on justice as well as consequence. Who deserves justice and who is allowed to give it? By the end when the credits roll, I realized that Ellie‚Äôs desire for revenge was truly about what we see in the last flashback scene. Forgiveness. Abby took away Ellie‚Äôs ability to forgive Joel. He died and she hadn‚Äôt done it and clearly needed more time to work through it. I also realized how that revenge lust cost her permanently. Physically but also mentally, as she symbolically cannot play the tune any more to remember Joel. She knew that it was a permanent fracture that killing Abby wouldn‚Äôt mend. As for Abby, she was flawed exactly as Joel was and had the ability to care and be a parental figure just as Joel was. I found it very powerful seeing her protect and live for Lev. I love Joel but he is very flawed. So it isn‚Äôt fair to judge Abby alone simply out of emotion for a beloved character. I know without doubt that Joel would do the same thing to Abby if he was in the situation. And technically he did. He killed her father for Ellie; different motivations but death all the same. And they see the same outcome; being hunted in revenge. But the cycle of revenge must stop somewhere. Ellie stopped it because of Joel. He became the true hero of the story at the end. And his legacy of true love can be seen through Abby since she lives. I think it‚Äôs brilliant but just my take",2020-07-06T20:31:10Z,0,0

And yes, I'm going to spoil everything so keep that in mind.
Yep, you're already showing it. When talking about Joel's death you talk about how it makes no sense. HOW? First of, it's fairly obvious that these guys are fireflies but as the game CLEARLY lays out for you later, Joel killed Abby's father, the surgeon. After 4 years of trying to find them she gets a lead on his brother Tommy. THAT'S who they were there to find, hoping he would know where Joel is. So when he introduces himself as Tommy, and then his brother Joel they know it's him! And what's with that bullshit sketch? I get it's supposed to be a representation of how you think he clearly gave too much info to these strangers seemingly out of character but all they gave was a first name and that they lived down the road. In 99.9% of situations that would be perfectly fine, even in a world like this.
And the whole point of the game is spit on Joel? Really Joe? Again, he killed Abby's father and wiped out an entire group to save Ellie. Those actions would obviously have consequences. Period. 
And you criticize the story for being predictable? You READ the leaks so you already had a blueprint for how the story was going to play out! Such a dishonest take.

Your next complaint can be summed up as ""I'm mad I didn't get another game where I'm just playing as Joel and Ellie again"" even though that would make zero sense given how the last game ended. Either she believed his lie but when inevitably find out the truth, WHICH SHE DID, and would rightfully be royally pissed off at him or you would have to somehow justify Ellie KNOWING Joel lied and yet being okay with it. Neither of those work and unless you want a game that just picked off right where the first one ended, this was always gonna be what you got. Period. Again, get the fuck over yourself. And yeah, people end up broken and destroyed in this game and that pisses you off? Well fucking duh Joe, have you seen THAT world. NO ONE, and I mean no one, survives in that world without trauma and being broken in some way. This isn't a fucking fairy tale. It sounds like you wanted everyone to end the game happy and without a care in the world. 

""Abby's jacked even though it makes no sense in this world"" he says as he shows the clip of a FULLY FUNCTIONING GYM IN A FOOTBALL STADIUM. I mean I'm glad you didn't harp on her for having huge muscles but that was fucking stupid Joe.

Oh good, more of the same point from before of not wanting to play a new character. Cool. And Ellie gets nothing and Abby get's all the attention? I'm sorry, you seem to have forgotten the previous game, DLC, and numerous comics that have already told us all about Ellie. You also seem to have forgotten that you play as Ellie for most of the game here as well with more of her story. But 10 hours of a new protagonist and suddenly it's Abby getting all the attention? Are you high? She's a brand new character! Of course it's gonna have to reveal her story and backstory more than Ellie's. We KNOW her story and past already. And then your sketch seems to suggest that Ellie was left weaponless or some nonsense. They have the same amount of weapons and tools Joe, they just have different styles of how to deal with threats. And your constant suggestion that Neil hates Joel and Ellie is one of the most absurd things I've ever heard. 
No Joe, you play as Ellie for about 20 hours and Abby as 10. Don't lie. And best weapons is subjective. The only real difference is that Abby has a crossbow vs just a bow. Molotovs vs pipe bombs, I prefer molotovs, and Abby gets a semi auto rifle vs a bolt action rifle with slightly less ammo. The Hunting Pistol and incendiary shotgun rounds are about it but they all cost resources to make and Abby also has to create shivs since she can't stealth kill clickers or stealthily kill any enemy quickly like Ellie can.

Jesus I'm never gonna finish this video.
""See, Ellie bad, Abby good.""
Never a point of the game Joe. Neil has talked about this in length. There is no judgment of the characters actions or your actions. It's simply showing you that there is another side to the violence. In a normal game, you would kill the WLF and their dogs and move on, never thinking about the background of the nameless NPC you just killed. But this game shows you that no, these are just as real people in this world as the protagonist. They have names, friends, animal companions and aren't just this generic evil that any other game, even the first TLOU, would normally show them as. And again, it's not trying to shove down your throat that Ellie is a monster or that Abby is actually a good moral person. Everyone is just trying to survive to the best of their ability.
And while I'm on that subject, the game even goes out of it's way to still give Abby shit for her past terrible deeds. Mel fucking calls her out on it! But I guess you clearly ignored that part so you could hammer in this garbage narrative that the game clearly wants you to hate Ellie and now praise Abby instead. Horseshit Joe.
""It's so emotionally manipulative.""
It's not Joe but surely if you keep saying it it must be true. I guess that means you feel all of Ellie's flashbacks to when Joel and her were still on good terms in manipulative too? Oh you don't? Odd.

I'll give you the love story between Abby and Owen. I thought it was fine but I can at least understand not caring for it and for the sex scene jarring you out of it. That's fine.
Although again Joe, what is this hatred you have of Neil. He's now fucking TLOU II? Or he has a hard on for Abby? You're reading WAY too much into this man.

""There's Neil Druckman right there"" 
Shut the fuck up Joe. No it's not. Neil loves Joel and it's plainly obvious when you listen to him talk about him. Ashley, Troy, and Neil love these characters to death BUT PEOPLE DIE IN THIS WORLD, usually pretty quickly and brutally. Play the first game again if you don't believe me. Again, it sounds like you're just pissed that a character you love didn't get to live happily forever and ever and you're coming up with every bullshit rationalization you can think of to justify not liking that. It's weak Joe.

""Who's Danny?"" We don't fucking know who because we don't care about these people""
Meaning YOU WEREN'T PAYING ATTENTION. It clearly states just a couple of hours before this that Owen went out on a patrol with DANNY! They even have a few more lines talking about how much of a dick Danny is. Them finding his corpse tells them that something may have also happened to Owen since he wasn't among the bodies. It's the WHOLE FUCKING REASON Abby sneaks out of camp that night, so she can go track him down and figure out what happened.

And it's fine if joe feels this way. However I kinda have a different perspective. I like the realistic theme of your actions have consequences. Joel killed abby's father and a bunch of other people in the last game. Which triggered a chain reaction. That led to his death and ellie wanting revenge. Its also shows that things aren't so black and white either and that abby is a decent person and that was driven by revenge too just like ellie was.

You can't show me a girl brutally torturing someone to death in front of their child then expect me to relate to her because she has a dog. The story is so manipulative and patronizing that it's not just unenjoyable, but irritating to sit through. If you have to make me feel like a dirtier person than I know I am just to like your character, I'll hate your character more for it. I don't care how woke and redpilled she is, she murdered someone who just saved her life and then felt no remorse for it. This story made me feel like a worse person for no real reason.

But I disagree with Joe, I do understand why he feels some way towards parts of the game somethings I think to make sense for example when they talk about how characters don't act how they should he needs to realize 4 years have passed. So Joel and Tommy have been in Jackson and in a civilization letting people in and trading with others so Joel actually lets his guard down and doesn't think anyone is after him because it has been four years. Abby not killing Ellie and Tommy is because she just wanted to kill Joel she had no idea who Tommy was or even Ellie so she found no need to kill them at all she got her revenge and that was it. And the way Joel dies though I would've liked something better it is understandable and fits in the world because it is a fucked up world and no one gets a hero's death people, die and another thing is no one is a hero in this world as much as we love Joel he killed so many fireflies, killed Abby's father who could've made the cure and stole the only cure in the world. I don't know about you but I think his death fit. And I don't think the game tries to force you to like Abby I think it just shows you her perspective and her road to redemption while Ellie is going through the exact same path Abby just went through and though I get you are upset you didn't get to kill Abby this isn't YOUR story this is Ellie and it is a story of the price of revenge and the losses that come with it. Ellie becomes so blind with rage that she kills hundreds of people, tortures people, and kills a pregnant lady. At the end of Seattle Ellie realizes she has done too much for the name of revenge and before she leaves she is faced with her advisory and loses Jesse and almost Tommy(which I am so surprised he didn't die, I thought he should've). And once again Abby spares her because as she says she has stopped looking for the light and vel is someone she is fighting for someone pure and reignites her original cause to help people. When Ellie finally has a chance to kill Joel if you notice right before she does she gets a good memory of Joel not when he is beaten and dead and it shows that Ellie still has some humanity in her. And when she returns home Dina has left her with JJ her relationship with Tommy is broken and she can't even play the song Joel has taught the full force of what revenge brings to somebody. There is so much more I could talk about and I am sure we could debate this game for hours and I am sure that is what the developers wanted in mind. Either way I love you Joe you make great content keep up the good work this just happens to be the one thing I don't agree with you.",2020-07-06T19:15:53Z,2,1

But the main one for me is what underpins Abby's story and by extension the whole game: i.e. the murder of her father. Frankly, I couldn't give a fuck about him. He gets all of five minutes of screen time, in which we see him rescue a zebra (thumbs up), and then plot to dissect a little girl while she's still alive, without having the balls to tell her to her face, or consult her de facto father figure. Fuck him. In essence it's like the game is desperately trying to justify the killing of Joel, who I do like and care about.

I've been a follower of your content for years since the early days. I loved your reviews and your insight into movies and games. I watched every single one of your YT videos, watched you on Twitch, and followed you on Twitter.  While this isn't aimed directly towards this video in particular, I've noticed that your content has gradually shifted to appease a certain toxic demographic within your fanbase. While your YT videos are generally non-controversial, you are more candid in your Twitch streams and have said things that could be perceived as sexist or misogynist. You may not even be aware of your bias, but as an avid consumer of your content, the change in your tone when women appear on screen is definitely noticeable. For someone who claims not to be misogynist, you sure have a lot of opinions when women become protagonists in movies or video games. There are enough 'the Quarterings' on YT, so I hope you do not become another one. While most likely unintentional, I believe you have drifted away from what I used to like about your content.

Pacing is shit. Characters are uninteresting and forgettable. Marketing was deceptive. Pointless sex scene. And the ending is half good half bad, it's interesting how Ellie is now alone which was her biggest fear and she can't play the guitar and ""if i ever were to lose you i'd surely lose myself"" translates into Ellie losing herself revenge but it was badly paced and dragged out and for whatever fucking reason Abby loves Lev like it's her kid. It's more negative than positive and half of the negative really outshines the positive. So a 4.5-5/10 is good enough for this game.

Its just hard these days to say anything on the internet without attracting any kind of negativity, I hope you continue to speak your heart and make us laugh in your reviews, I dont envy you one bit for all the praise/negativity your popularity and presence subjects you to. I'm just some guy with a stable 40 hour job who draws as a hobby on the side, that never had an ambitious bone in my body.

The internet is in a dark age of civil war where anything said can be interpreted as negative, and can potentially be retaliated with negativity, which then gets shot down negatively. Theres so much sheep on the internet, wolves in sheep clothing, and sheeps in wolf clothing that everyone forgot that we are all human and that all our opinions are valid and that cranking these opinions to 11 into the realm of Sarcasm, venomocity and flat out lies for the sake of driving a point is auto-destructive. 

Stay honest, stay yourself, and dont become bitter of everyone and everything, thats just contagious nowadays. Lets all hope for a better internet experience in the futur where opinions and ideas will collide and create rather than destroy.",2020-07-06T16:21:31Z,0,0

I had the same bad moment with the new Star Wars movies. At some point I noticed that they do not develope characters in a proper way. They give us hints about maybe this and that, but no....  the explanations never comes. Just more nonsense. What happened to all the good writers?  Did they all get sacked and replaced them with brainless people?!?
I just ""passively"" watched an episode of My little pony with my daughter and noticed that even this cartoon series made for kids makes much better sense, has much better charachter arcs, and in a whole stories that interconnect and make the viewer interested in seeing more, learn more. Basically makes it immersive for its intended audience.  
After last 2 years of so much dissapointment in stories that had so much potential (Game of thrones, Star Wars, LOU2 +++++) it seems like what they all have in common is lack of connection with its own audience (fans, but also the common human viewer). It is beyond belief that projects with this kind of money, end up with charachters that do not even make sense. And to sum it up end with endings that dissapoint in all accords.",2020-07-06T16:10:29Z,0,0

When you make something revolutionary and amazing, and assume that from then on every single brain fart you will ever have will be pure diamond dust, and ignore every single advice or criticism.

I just can't imagine the Naughty Dog team never mentioning to Neil Druckmann how bat shit crazy his vision was. He probably just ignored them, saying: ""Oh sorry, are you the genius who blessed the world with the first game? No? Who was that then? That's right, me!

This game does a fantastic job of humanizing the main antagonist and blurring the line between who the real villain is. Was Joel a fundamentally good person in the original? Hell no. Likewise, is Ellie being fundamentally good when she drags her friends into her revenge plot and murders countless people trying to kill Abbey who was trying to kill Joel because he murdered her father?

Considering how much hate they've gotten . The Last of Us part two should've been more like, Ellie finding out the truth, then holding a grudge toward Joe (like it did in the beginning of part two).  But during that four years, she slowly open back up to Joe and had forgivin him. At the end of the game, Joe had a big battle with the fireflies. Ellie finds out that Joe had die which would make a good mark for the end of part two of Last Of Us. The rest of the stuff for part three, they could've done that for Abby. Around part three fans would understand why ellie couldn't kill Abby. So IDK.. This is just my opinion all I know is that. They could've done a better job at making it more lasting (Our Joe) for the Fans. When Joe died, I felt sad but I didn't feel sad enough to cry.

While I agree with some of the Joe's points I must say that for me story made a lot of sense. Why? Well, we all know how incredibly important the cure thing was to Ellie. It was her driving factor, this journey for the cure transformed Joel from the grumpy smuggler to her father figure. Now, the second part goes deeper with the part where Ellie knows that she was the cure and Joel took it from her and lied about it. So this was the first blow she received  and it's showed really well in the second game. Then the second punch she got is Abby murdering Joel on her eyes. So now Ellie has those contradicting states: hate for Joel for lining abut the cure, hate for Abby for killing him and on top more loyal attachment to Joel  because of the fact that he was murdered. It's quite complicated, and this condition is getting worse and worse as the story goes. Yes, Ellie is broken here but I can clearly see why and to be honest I accept it. For me this makes her character in the game even better and more human.",2020-07-06T11:13:51Z,0,2

You do not have to kill any human NPC's you can stealth the set pieces or use the infected. The only section on survivor plus I had to fight was the last part of the rattlers compound, just before the prisoner release.  If you kill human NPC's then that's on you. I firmly believe that we will not get a Last of Us part 3. I can't wait for the multiplayer game, the multiplayer from the first game is superb.",2020-07-06T09:53:01Z,0,2

Not to the game but to you AngryJoe for the first time in years watching this channel. The game has problems, that's the fact, like off pacing. But in this review you lack the level of deeper thoughts, most of the point you made were only on the surface level, like why Joel was that careless (after 4 damn years of peace, being old, and dealed with outsider of Jackson's all the time like the way he traded to have coffee, he should let his guard down the way he did for god's sake, and he had no choice in that moment but follow Abby - the person he just saved, come to the place he knew), he wasn't out of character at all, it's the change in people, time does that to us, don't force what you knew and what you think he shoulda, woulda, coulda done, you don't know him like you think you do, no one does. Even if we all love Joel, he deserved what happened to him after what he did, and part 2 doesn't has to tread the same ground like part 1 did, throw another advanture with Joel and Ellie in the lead. 

And to the decision of Ellie not to kill Abby, it was perfect. Stop telling us if this is a revenge story, and revenge has to be conducted to the target person. This is a PTSD Ellie realized that revenge won't give her peace even after the farm life she had, it's her choice to tackle the matter. And with the memory of Joel, she spared Abby, after that moment, she can remember Joel's face again, she got peace, Joel was honored.

Another thing, Abby was awesome, even if she the one who killed Joel, but with her gameplay part, i came to emperthized her action. She's just like Ellie, tried to find peace. She doesn't has to feel regret with what she did to Joel, her dad was killed by him. Even if we understand why Joel saved Ellie which was one way to cope with his lost, it doesn't mean everyone in the world of this game has to, no one knew what he thought. In Fireflies's eyes, he's monters for killing so many member. Joel was not a hero. 

From now on, i will be careful not to take every words from the video of this channel.",2020-07-06T08:57:44Z,2,1

I hate it because I wanted to see more of Joel and Ellie, Instead of having Joel and Ellie being spit apart from each other I would've put them together so that we can see this now damaged relationship because of how Ellie finds out how he lied and it can keep the flashback so we learn how, and instead of ellie finding Joel being killed, it's her being with him up until his final moments. and if you wanna say that ""if she can't forgive him why would she do runs with him."" you could justify it by it being Tommy and his wife signing them up to do the routes together so that they can give Joel opportunity to talk to ellie and what now, anyway moving on. I'm not mad that joel died because after finishing the first game I wanted to see a revenge story because I wanted to see how the consequences of Joel affected everything and honestly I expected him to die and i was okay with it. I don't hate him dying because his death was justified by the consequences of his actions in the end of the first game. so for me the main themes I took from this game is consequences and perspective. I can see the forgiveness aspect theme too so I can safely say that If I play it again then I can see that theme there, But what I saw the most was perspective and consequences. for the perspective aspect, it's that everyone can be a bad guy to someone. when you play as ellie you see Abby as the villain for killing joel and to you no seemingly good reason. when you play as abbey you learn that joel is her villain and it's because Joel took her father's life. and something I loved was that in the first last of us, not only was ellie the second chance of a daughter for Joel, she was also the thing that could change joel into becoming a better person. in abbeys story everyone regards her as an asshole and is even haunted for violently killing joel and that boy you save from the cult becomes her redemption. there's even a scene with abbey and him that mirrors the same camera work as the scene from the first game when joel and ellie were in the truck together. they become parallels. so it stands that I do love and hate this game because I love the themes but it's also not exactly the sequel I would've made. but not the less I still loved it but i still have my issues",2020-07-06T08:37:33Z,0,0

This wasn't.   The execution of Joel was sick, visually distressing and over the top.  The characters you're supposed to sympathise with (the baddies), you don't.   I mean, what was that shit about playing fetch with the 100% tame and loveable dog??  Of course Ellie is gonna kill it if it's a rabid dog trying to eat her!!

Imagine how much better it would have been if this had bee  pitched from day-one as a spin off?  You play as child Abby and then move ahead through her life.  The muscle monster that she was could have been shown gradually.  Then the 2nd last chapter ends with the player discovering that her parents were killed by Joel.  It would be a great unsuspected twist.  Then instead of hunting Joel down, what if years later she just happened to come across him?  Drop all the golf club / shotgun torture porn and just have the game end with a choose your own ending - do you shoot Joel or not?",2020-07-06T07:39:52Z,0,0

Would this series be even more successful if it was a high end Sony TV series? Still, if you are going to make the theme of your next game be about cycles of revenge, you would think that would leave room for much, much more agency. I mean, for example, imagine some sort of morality and alliance system, when you add the f'd up variables of this world, that could have made the storytelling gameplay that much more excellent.

I dunno, it's cool of Sony to try and do a Trans-female character... it probably shouldn't be at the expense of a cis-female character because it's not like that issue is suddenly solved... but even then, it feels like a disservice to do it this way. They probably could have made Abby much more popular and cooler if they gave them more of an arc and be more of a bridge character.

I hated The Last of us, mainly for how much of a hack the makers seem to be- given that the whole story was ripped off from other places and told again like it was new (which apparently for a lot of people it was- I dont get it). I also hated the ending. Like, for real. Ellie should never talk to Joel again. He's a piece of trash. I dont play DLC let alone support bad games so I never played the story that told more about Ellie. I just don't care. I thought the writing in the first game was just so bad.
So, it's interesting because now the glamour has worn off so people are complaining about... the bad writing.
I never thought that game needed a sequel in the first place so this game seemed bad from the announcement that there would be one.
Love the muscles on that girl, Abby, though. I find that attractive. Too bad, like usual, its forced and not actual character development.
Dont worry. Word on the street is we'll be paying more for video games soon. What's sad is ya'll will still eat that shit up all while crying about it.",2020-07-06T05:53:50Z,0,0

Face facts here. Joel slaughtered an entire group of people to fulfill his selfish needs. Then when those people came back for revenge by killing ONLY HIM, Ellie goes and kills EVERYBODY ABBY KNOWS. And yet Abby still lets Ellie live a second time, only for Ellie to track her down AGAIN. I jokingly let Abby kill me during the final battle and disclaimed ""happy ending!"" I'm also proud of Ellie for letting Abby live. 

I certainly don't agree with a 10/10 score. This game had it's flaws. Yes, the first game was much better, and suddenly controlling Abby was jolting. But I still enjoyed the hell out of this game, as well as the story. I don't want The Last of Us 2 to be Joel and Ellie traipsing off on another adventure, and while in my opinion Joel dying in the fashion he did have been better served to be placed in the eventual 3rd game, I give the creators props for doing something that none of us would have seen coming.

I think giving this game a 3/10 would be considerably generous. Anything more than that is just being way to nice when the game is clearly hot garbage. A 6/10 is very high for a game that is painful or not fun to play is something that i dont agree with either. The purpose of a game is for entertainment and enjoyment. This game according to how you portray it, blatantly shows this game produces the opposite effect therefore nullifying or completely conflicting with the entire purpose of why it even exists. Neil druckman might as well have sold a hollow paperweight made out of Styrofoam. So your review of 6/10 of something that emits the effect of the complete opposite of the intended purpose is inadequate.

Joe called it sequelcitis. Love of 1st game ruins the 2nd. It took 2 weeks for me to step back and really look into the game. I read tons and listened tons. What I got from it all is basically, you the player are Ellie. You have to literally picture yourself as ellie. Not sympathize or think ellie is bad abby good. The entire game is a metaphor. It's basically flipping a mirror onto the players. This game was to much and we all held onto the passion from part 1 and it detoured us from the entirety of part 2. It's understandable. I have been pissed for 2 weeks. However after reading and honestly what helped me see it as basically a 4th wall..or this is a 3d game for your emotions. We like ellie knew why we were killing, for revenge. It's why we kill the dogs. Abbys side shows how we do not care for abby. Like real life we didnt wanna know abby or see her side. Ir it felt boring. This was on purpose to show you how we act in real life. The game forces you to face your love for ellie, face your selfishness for the first game..it showed how we wouldnt take the time of day to give abby a shot..cause we literally are ellie. It's why we dont connect to the players cause we are ellie and are feeling what she is feeling. This game needs a 4th wall manual. You are supposed to feel things at certain places which we normal gamers who just want an adventure and fun cause games are for fun. Not this. That is the ambiguous part of part 2 nobody saw. Either you see it and sympathize yourself and ellie to see right or wrong and feel the redemption and forgiveness. Or like me and joe you wanted revenge and didnt care about abby or her friends. It was an ambiguous 4th wall of our feelings for ellie herself what she is going through. Then when you beat it you realize like real life you judged abby like we do in real life. No right or wrong. Which inturn we are being judged by the game and how we are acting. The metaphor proved right watching them hate abby and and even the sex scene. We judged a real human being is what the game wanted us to feel. You have to believe the story and realize you are ellie at all times. Nobody talks about this cause like most of us this is deep as hell and the game doesnt let you know or tell you. I came across an audiobook storytelling type video where a youtuber speaks clearly, intellectually, clearly from beginning of part 1 and lou2. , also it helps to show how to feel and when throughout the entire game. It made so much sense with every moment in the game. Its a really long audio.  I may not like the game but the story itself if you can detach yourself and listen it really helps. Which inturn does prove Neil made this game for himself and cronies and not for the fans. This game is reflecting our prejudices our biases our stereotypes is how I took it too. Still it was a great listen.",2020-07-06T03:39:21Z,0,0

Nothing can use the crutch: ""We put a woman as the main character! We put an all African American cast, we have an all-gay cast, etc...""  I don't care. Give me something GOOD out of that. Give me a great game, I'll buy it and play it, no matter who the characters are. I hated Ghostbusters the remake (all women) because it sucked. I am dreading the new Red vs Blue season 18, because of how freaking poor it sounds when they're just starting production AND they're just focusing on ""diversity"" and ""family"". I love DOA: XBV, I love Leisure Suit Larry, but I also love a strong female protagonist and Blackish. 

It has to be good, they need to stop using the ""diversity"", ""gender"" and ""race"" as a crutch for sellers and make terrible games using that crutch. It's freaking annoying.",2020-07-06T01:47:13Z,78,2506

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-sTlYUeT8o,The Last of Us Part II - Angry Review,2020-07-02T02:32:07Z,@Sorites,"SPOILERS - Read only if you have finished the game.

I don't think you can call this game predictable, when you literally watched all the spoilers that were leaked. I didn't watch the spoilers, and I can say I didn't see a lot of these coming.  At 18:56 Joe claimed that ""we are told that the old characters are bad and that the new characters are good."" I'm surprised he missed the point, not to mention that he is wrong. Whenever your playing the game from Ellie's perspective, the game shows Abby's group of characters to be bad. When you are playing from Abby's side, it shows Ellie's group of characters to be bad. This isn't because it's trying to manipulate you, it's because it's showing the game from each sides perspective. From Ellie's view Abby's the bad guy, and from the other the inverse. It's giving you both sides of the coin. This is one of the games core themes, it's even visible with the fighting between the WLF and the Scars.

Not to mention that the whole argument about the ending being ""terrible storytelling"" is weird. Considering one of the greatest writers in history, Alexandre Dumas, wrote the Count of Monte Cristo with a similar ending. The book he wrote follows a similar plot, where the main character is hurt by some people near the beginning of the book and is on a revenge quest. 

Joe claims his review is not biased, even though he watched all the leaks, he claims his main issue with the game is that he wanted a different story with Joel as a more predominant character. That Abby and a lot of the other characters were written poorly. Yet before it's revealed who Abby is or what she is going to do, he find it funny to make this character repeatedly (let me emphasis the word repeatedly here) kill herself because he hates the character. His opinion at the end of the day is his own, and reflects how he feels about the game. Lots of people don't like every story ever written. But he is claiming to know the characters better than the writer's who wrote them into existence do. On another note, personally, I think the core gameplay/stealth mechanics the game is based around are perfect. They are immersive, I loved them in the first game and they have perfected the mechanics in the second. 

On the golf club scene, I also don't get the argument that it was rushed. It was a powerful scene meant to make the player feel the same emotion that Ellie was feeling, and damn did it work.  I loved the game, understand why people don't, but don't understand the criticism for why they don't. It almost always boils down to, ""I don't like that they killed Joel"" in some shape or another.  I can't wait to play the sequel if it gets made. This game was a 9/10 for me, because the pacing definitely was a little off. But after finishing it and reflecting on it, the story just fits into place beautifully. If you read this far and haven't played the game, I'm sorry the game was spoiled for you, but I highly recommend you play the game for yourself. I think Joe missed the mark on this one.",2020-07-06T01:26:07Z,6,9

I am not saying it is perfect, story being too long can be a little tiring, losing beloved characters might not give pleasant emotions, but it was one of the best games I ever played. I think people would be better off to stand their positions, as I am sure there were a lot of people who really loved the game before rushing off to internet to see what others do think about it and easily change their minds.

The one who was dying because he was stuck beneath something with a cracked mask in the middle of spores? And then Joel, if you make him, shoots the guy, fulfilling his dying request for a better death? His grandmother was actually on her way to help him, and now she wants revenge. She traced the bullet back to its manufacturer, who remembers selling Joel the gun. She then spends the years tracking Joel down, eventually learning of Jackson. In order to spit on his grave, she then burns Jackson down - but that is not all. In the sequel, Ellie can be seen touching the dirt before Joel's tombstone. The grandmother used to be a grave-digger, and she can smell where the scent of earth travels. She uses this ancient method to track down Ellie, who has befriended fireflies and is about to give away the cure. Everyone ultimately dies; however, it turns out that Dina's son remembers Ellie, and he has come to meet her. Said son wants to kill the grandmother, but Ellie stops him by saying his name. The boy then takes the bullet home, realizing how violence is an endless cycle. He goes on a journey to tell these words to the gunsmith; however, as he arrives, said gunsmith has just been killed by Abby over a silly matter. The son then throws the bullet at Abby, making her head explode. The curse is then lifted, causing all Infected to disappear. But this is just a twist. Neil Druckman himself then spawns as the final boss, but you cannot kill him. The only way is to realize how much of a corner this story has written itself into, turning off the console.

Like they should have ended it right when Tommy came visit and NOT have him trying to convince ellie to go alone to take down a woman that almost killed both of them. I would have been forgiving of everything else (because it was actually and okay story besides playing as Abby for much of the game) but them decided to completely ruin Ellie's life at the end was taking it waayyyy too far. Not to mention I don't believe Tommy to be a man who would risk, for the 2nd time,  losing his wife and family hunting down someone. EXPECIALLY when he already told Ellie when they met up at the theater that they would likely have to just forget about chasing after Abby. His change of heart made no sense. Plus it was selfish of him to have Ellie go after her alone KNOWING ellie has a family now. I don't believe Tommy to be that type of guy expecially when he left and went off without Ellie in the begining because he didn't want her to go into danger. Not to mention it was kind of a kick in the face for Ellie to go back only to realize that if she had just let them be Abby would have died a horrible dead by those bandits anyway. Another point that was completely ridiculous was Ellie forcing Abby to fight her but she took on a weak smaller Abby with a knife. How is that a fair fight Ellie?? At least give Abby a knife.

You clearly turned your brain off once Joel died and ignored all of the character development with Abby. She is empty until she finds Lev and Yara and discovers purpose again after getting revenge on Joel doesn't fix her nightmares. You clearly see her nightmares develop from seeing her father dead in the hospital room to seeing Lev and Yara hanging in the hospital room to seeing her father happy and alive in the hospital.

While I was playing, I kept thinking, 'If you knew that, why didn't you just run away before shaving your head?  Then your executioners wouldn't be hot on your heels'.
Druckmann obviously realised we would all feel the same way so Abby actually asks the same question the player is thinking.  She says, 'Why didn't you just wait for a good opportunity and then just leave'.  Lev's answer?  'I don't know'.  Biggest decision in his whole life and 'he doesn't know'

One I think Joe going into the game already knowing a decent amount of the plot gave him a biased opinion off of the bat. I avoided spoilers like the plague before the game came out and when you don't know what is going to happen at all the story was actually really good not as good as the first but still good and enjoyable.
As far as playing as Abby I think it was actually a good storyline. The game showed you how shit is more morally gray than black and white. We got to see pros and cons from Ellie and her friend's side, the wolf's side and the scar's point of view. I think it was cool to see the points of views from all these different groups rather than just more evil mindless bad guys to fight. Not saying there are not cons in the story (definitely are some) but playing as Abby and seeing her group's view was not one of them. 
 Lastly idk what difficulty Joe is playing on but  it looks like he is on an easier difficulty. Playing this game on a harder difficulty makes the gameplay far more enjoyable. It makes the gameplay more intense and stealth is a must rather than just punching zombies like your some mma fighter. The gameplay was actually improved from the first, better stealth like proning, smarter enemies searching for you, dodging mechanics and more open areas. It is similar enough to the first gameplay wise but also improves a lot and adds mechanics like a proper sequel should. But playing on an easy difficulty the intense gameplay and new features are not as essential and won't stick out as much.
The gameplay is far better than the first and the story definitely has flaws and not as good as the first but still is good.",2020-07-05T21:27:59Z,0,0

Joel should have died in the first game, several times, but definitely in the end. A well placed fist to fist fight with a familiar face and a well placed bullet. If I remember correctly, he was even cornered in the garage as he attempted to escape. 

The time to die would have been in there truck rude away from the compound. Eli wakes up, that chat, and shortly after, he begins to fade from blood loss. Setting Eli on a journey of growing up and surviving *alone*.

""We wouldve loved abby if she had her own game"" how does that even make sense? This IS her game what are u talking about? Tlou2 isnt perfect and has issues but its disturbing to see fandom become devoid of any objectivity because they didnt get what they wanted. The very fact that u screamed about ellie and joel not being the same as they were in the first game, 5 years before this game, but also complained about not having any progression or development with the characters as if that time spent, as told through the flashbacks, wasnt rich with a multifacet of complex development for both Ellie, Joel, and Abby filling in the gaps of who ellie is at the age of 19 in contrast with who she was at 14 and who Joel has become since the ending of the first game. Not to mention ur straw manning of the development shown by Ellie and Abby in the present to the end an entire year later shows a complete lack of objectionable critique and is a hollow representation of the narrative. This entire video is a straw manning, empty, shallow understanding of the narrative in favor of your expectation. Its the same tired ""we didnt get what we wanted"" and then using that as the basis for why the narrative is bad without any deductive reasoning and does nothing but show a clear bias on ur part.",2020-07-05T19:17:37Z,3,1

Quality of content is steadily dropping and this takes the cake. You spent roughly 35 minutes whining about plot and ""your beloved chafacters"" and only under 5 minutes about other aspects of the game. Very classy but ubfortunately completely useless to someone looking for some objective info.I wanted to refute this video point by point but at the end I realized it would be too long and moot endeavor so I just make a few points.
You must have been really distraught watching MCU movies where none of main  characters diec until very end by virtue of being main characters, aka plot armor.
You whine about Abby getting everything better, lets say weapons, while Ellie has literally best melee weapon against infected (switchblade), her bolt action rifle is guaranteed kill into body when upgraded and her throwables, especially molotovs, are miles better than what Abby has at her disposal.
You also must have missed, or you ragged phased out of conciousness, whole plot involving Yara and Lev where it was clearly indicatec Abby has self-doubts and is regreting some of her past actions.

Ultimately, you have ratec the game as 6/10, which is not out of whack rating. However, it is completely out of balance with you ranting in the nearly 50-minute long video. 
TLOU2 is competent game when it comes to its mechanicsmthat improved certain aspects (AI, combat and stealth) of its predecessor. The game plays better than the original but due to its treatment of story elements will not be standing next to the original when looking back.",2020-07-05T18:26:58Z,2,1

Second game: Ellie and Joel have a falling out because he lied to her. She goes off on her own, we get some cool cutscenes/ flashbacks(that don't have weird placements) and we give Ellie a boyfriend instead of a girlfriend, so she could get pregnant in the end and pass on her immunity. On the way she meets Abby. We get to know her a little and since Joel will be absent for most of it, we get a good friendly dynamic between them with great chemistry that we would have got with Joel and Ellie. We get attached to Abby but in the end she finds out the Ellie knows Joel. We cut to Abby with Owen, and her people she says ""I know where he is."" And cut to black. That's the end of the second game.
Third game:
So that way when she kills Joel in the third game we feel so stupid that we got attached to her in the last game and it feels like a huge gut punch. Then when Ellie and Abby fight at the end there's more emotional weight. At that moment when they've beaten each other to a pulp they try sympathize with each other, Ellie is crying while she's yelling at the top of her lungs at Abby about how she feels betrayed and she trusted her. Then we learn why Abby did it. Ellie let's her go barely alive. She goes back to the farm and her baby and boyfriend are still there. That way she didn't get her revenge but she still gets to keep everything she gained. Bam! Happy ending(kinda). Better than the ending in the game. 
Or, you could have Ellie kill Abby but go back to the farm with everyone gone. So Ellie got her revenge, but at what cost?",2020-07-05T18:17:43Z,13,27

P.S : Joel killed Abby's Dad with one shot and did not killed the rest and, so, i will never understand Abby's narrative as to why she went avenging her Dad's death. Her Father was selfish and unfair to the people who sacrificed their lives  to bring Ellie to the Hospital for a curse and yet failed to tell them the truth to the People about how the procedure was gonna be and it was then Joel finds out her beloved new found daughter who was gonna die cause the so called heroes decide to kill a girl who was not consulted whether she wanna make that sacrifice to save many lives.None of then surgeons really know for sure if the cure would work if they'd killed her to retrieve the sample to find the cure.

I've said this before, it's a great way to get across the whole ""grey"" story. There is no black and white, no good and evil.
Just because you're playing from one side in the first game doesn't necessarily mean that there the good guys and the other side are the bad guys.
Killing off a beloved character drives a revenge plot.
Getting to play as the person who killed this beloved character gives the the perspective of the other side and drives the ""grey"" story.
The had to be consequences for Joels actions at the end of the first game.
From what I'm hearing, the plot of part 2 was executed very badly.
What they should have done was have you play as Abby from the start for a while just so you get to see their side of the story before jumping back to Joel and Ellie.

I don't have a PS4 so haven't actually played it myself, and I've yet to finish watching a full play through, but again from the impression I'm getting it sounds like a great story poorly executed.",2020-07-05T16:58:06Z,0,0

It's like when you study Shakespeare or Tolstoy at school... not everyone gets it. We're living in an age were video games are far more than JUST video games... They're (in some cases) worthy of being called works of art, and I believe that Naughty Dog has crafted the first proper interactive media where there's soooo much more to it than the normal gameplay loop.
It actually requires careful thought, engagement and reaction to the events that happen. If you play this game properly then you'll probably find yourself thinking upon the events that transpired days later... that's how effective it is. Sadly, I think the target demographic for Naughty Dog these days is much older than the tween/millennial babies who  rule the internet. Funny how there's been so many, ""on second thoughts"" pieces flooding YouTube in the last few days. Almost as if the knee jerk reaction without proper thought/consideration of the art in question was a ploy to get dem sweet views.

The game is showing
Perspective. One of the central themes to the story, in fact.

Did you know that Tarrintino had at one time considered doing a kill bill sequel where the little black kid who watched the Bride kill her mother, was to grow older and get her revenge? 

Had that movie of come to fruition that would be equivocal to Ellie seeking revenge against Abbey after Abbey has killed her father figure. But who starts the cycle? The Bride who would of looked like a monster to the little black girl in the first Kill Bill movie because she killed her mother? But this was only done because her mother along with the rest of the deadly viper squad beat the Bride, left her for dead and were thought to have killed her unborn daughter. 

Now would the little black girl have been right for getting her revenge or more importantly would Uma Thurman‚Äôs Bride character not have been justified in taking out the people who attacked the chapel and left her for dead? 

Well folks, Abbey is Uma Thurman‚Äôs Bride character in this analogy and Ellie would be the little black chic that saw Vivica fox‚Äôs character killed in front of her. 

We as the audience root for Uma Thurman and have little empathy for the little black orphan because of context. We‚Äôve been following the Bride as she is the movie‚Äôs protagonist and we understand her motivations,her revenge and need for it. The game goes the step further to unpack for us what took Abbey to that point and quite frankly If I were Abbey I would of wanted Joel dead too,no negotiation no forgiveness, he dies painfully. 

It‚Äôs kind of ignorant to sweep that shit under the carpet because you have more attachment and relationship with Joel. Would you let it slide if you found out your best friend was a pedophile, or someone who drug raped women or a serial killer, just because they are your best friend? No. You wouldn‚Äôt, at least that‚Äôs me giving you the benefit of the doubt that you‚Äôre not a piece of shit. See I hold no prejudice against you for you shitting on this game. I still form opinions objectively.",2020-07-05T16:27:25Z,1,1

The Character named Joel represents a Father Character and love for his daugther as his own child. """"Who are they trying truely to show us here?""
It's the Story of Jesus, they are mocking him by sacrificing his man of virtue,  the origin of ""Joel"" is a hebrew Name, which means ""YAHWEH is God"" in the first Testament, ""Jesus is God"".    I am glad people are not tolerating this act type of brutality and satanic entertainment anymore, God bless all of us! 
We are living in the end days, seeing Sacrfices on real life TV, Sacrifices on Shows, Sacrifices on Video Games.

Compared to the borderline perfect writing that made TLOU 1 so compelling, 2 feels a little undercooked. It definitely could've and should've done with some extra layers of depth in order to feel more compelling. And yes, that one moment feels like the writers just wanted to introduce you to a new set of characters through shock value, which is basically shock value for the sake of shock value, a poor usage of this trick.

However, I do think that the game doesn't just border down to ""Abby good, Ellie bad"" and ""revenge sukz"". For example, the you know what moment is framed really early in the game, which immediately kills off Abby's potential to be considered likeable. However, the game then proceeds to portray her as bloodlusted, manic for carnage, but with some value to her. It shows you that she became deceased as a person with her desire for revenge completely consuming her. The effect that pain and the wish to cause pain has on a person. Ultimately, when she pets dogs and is shown to care somewhat about her party members, it's just to give you the potential that she had as a person and how that potential was scrambled away because she became obsessed with pain.

Likewise with Ellie. Throughout the game, she becomes colder and colder, putting all her allies in danger for one reason and one reason only: to cause pain. Because she needs it in order to cope with the pain that she felt. And when the ending comes and it's a total 180 degree on what she did throughout the game and what you were effectively promised, it's a cold water in the face reminder that you were about to get rewarded for sticking all the way through to the end with causing pain, after causing so much pain already and losing almost everything you cared for. Ellie too became obsessed with pain, both in how it affected her and how she wanted it to affect others. You're not given the moment of causing pain you waited for all game long... you're just stuck with the realization that you cost yourself almost everything and cost so many other people so much more for the mere act of hurting someone else. At that moment, if you still think the game can kiss your ass because it didn't give you the killshot you wanted, you're no better than Abby. Ellie came to that conclusion at the end, and in a world where there ain't good people, she became better for it. She's still a killer and she still caused so much destruction around her, but sometimes, we only learn with our mistakes when we the consequences of them. 

Would the game have benefitted from showing you more shades of grey in both Ellie and Abby's sides, especially since it doesn't seem to emphasize enough how both of them are in the wrong with their actions? 100%. Would the game have benefitted from better written supporting characters, a different story outline and more room for Joel? 100%. Would have the game benefitted from them not doing you know what, or at least that way? 10000000%. However, as it turned out, I think that it was a very potent exploration of the psychological impact of pain on people. It's certainly no TLOU 1 or Uncharted 4, but if it really is The Last Jedi of games, I stand by it like I stood for TLJ. It's not perfect, but it is solid and carries a message that should mean a lot in the world we live in today.",2020-07-05T15:18:40Z,0,0

Naughty Dog isn't going for ""Hey, Ellie bad now, but Abby good"", Joe. Besides, Ellie had no choice but to kill dogs trying to attack her, Abby did have a choice because the dogs she played with belonged to her group. You know, I think your initial bad impression of the leaks clouded your judgement of the game overall, unlike ACG or some others. I do think your rating is fair, but your constant gripes are a little much. One thing is for sure; no one in this series is safe. No one. So, to hell with re-engaging with the characters, because reality just smacks you upside the head like a golf ball sometimes.",2020-07-05T15:02:50Z,0,0

I didn't enjoyed Joels death, but he really killed alot of people and end like this seemed possible in my eyes. I didn't enjoyed Ellie as a lesbian, but I thought well If this is what she really is, then ok. I didn't enjoyed unexplained killings by Ellie, but I could understand that it is possible for her to be motivated by anger so maybe people could kill just for revenge. Even when I started playing as Abbie I tried to understand her and how she felt. But her segments were so long, so boriing and stupid as fuck. Ok I understand she wanted to help Yara and Lev, but killing her own people and for what? One kid insted of like 20 or more lifelong friends of Abbie? It just is so stupid. And in theatre when we catch up with Ellies story and still had to play as Abbie! WTF! Is this game about Ellie or what? I don't want to hurt Ellie! Fuck this Abbie shit! Fuck her! I let Ellie to kill me (Abbie) for like first 10 times before I even hit Ellie. I was cheering Ellie ""come on kill me"". This is joke this game isn't about Ellie. This is Abbies game and this sucks. Whats the point of this story? Ellie decited to go back after Abbie on more time and guess what? I'm playing as Abbie again! I can't finish this game. Been playing it since launch. It just gets worse and worse. First we get to play as Joel (excellent start), then as Ellie (great) and then as Abbie (well ok at first) and now one more time as Abbie! Fuck this shit. Wonder if I will get to play as Ellie one more time? And when does this game end? All that talk about overworked Naughty Dog people. Game could have been twice as short. Just end with Seattle Ellies part, but let us kill Abbie! And it would have been decent enaugh game. Everybody is dead. All what Par 1 created Part 2 destroyed. How could person who wrote The Last of Us write this shit? What happened to him? I guess Lev and Abbies relationship suppose to mimic Joels and Ellies in Part 1, but come on. It's just sad. Naughty Dog was like one of a few studios that delivered best games in the world. Now I just feel that they died. Naughty Dog no more....  Ellie is lesbian, Joel is dead. And why in the world Abbie is so Ripped? WTF? She looks like mutant. Like a freak!",2020-07-05T15:01:21Z,0,0

The way she is in the sequel is a logical (albeit somewhat predictable) continuation of her character arc. ""Revenge baad."" Well, everything seems trivial if all you see is the trivial. The Last of Us 2 had its flaws but ultimately it's another great game and easily one of the most profound games I've ever played. I can't recommend it highly enough.

I watched all your Stream Vids of you guys playing this game.....judging by the way you played and commented during EVERY cutscene, not giving a sht about what is happening, you should not be Reviewing it....
I get it that you're not invested in the game because of a few things and mainly the story, but at least try to stay quiet while watching the scenes...otherwise, every little bit of work put in them by the Devs does not matter, and you just seem like you're bent on hating the game from the beginning:
It is clear thjat Alex looked up the game's entire story before even playing, based on his comments in the Streams... Which beats the entire purpose of telling a story. I get you are ""Reviewers"", but at least make it right. 
Honestly, for the community, it would be better not to stream games you're reviewing...or at least have a different attitude if you choose to stream them... Literally, I've been watching you for the last decade, and I know you can do better, because you have in the past...

only now we have context we have an ENTIRE game hours upon HOURS of gameplay with her seeing her go from a broken crying girl mourning the death of her father to a hardcore survivor willing to do ANYTHING for revenge only to be saved by the VERY man she has spent YEARS hunting, she's got the weapon in hand but she hesistates because this man who she's spent so long hating and demonizing not only saved her life but trusted her with his but in the end she can't let go of her hatred or her revenge and so she kills Joel fades to black with Ellie's horrified screams slowly turning to sobs of agony, 

NOW we pick up T.L.O.U 3 which is set IMMEDIATELY after the last game (see above^) Ellie screams she'll kill them one of Abbys friend goes to kill her BUT Abby stops him shouting ""NO! not her"" Friend: Abby you HEARD her!, Abby:i don't care we're not killing her she hasn't done anything to us HE (points to Joel) did, reluctantly Abby's friend walks away muttering they'll regret this, Abby walks up to Ellie goes to aplogise but can't she sees the pain and hurt in Ellie's eyes and realises that she had the same eyes after her dad died ashamed she leaves, game picks up from there how it plays out only this time when Abby beats Ellie she screams at her :WHY!? WHY COULDN'T YOU JUST LEAVE US ALONE! WE LET YOU LIVE WE COULD HAVE KILLED YOU BUT INSTEAD WE LET YOU LIVE! with tears in her eyes she says: you've taken EVERYONE from me (looks over to Dana) picks up the knife and goes to kill her only for the scene to play out normally she screams FUCK! throws dana to the ground goes over to Ellie puts the knife right up to her eye and says :if i EVER see you again if you EVER come after me again i'll kill you then i'll kill everyone you've ever met i will BURN your precious settlement to the GROUND! game continues as normal, 

we're playing as Ellie drowning Abby, she's dying suddenly the game shows a button mash to drown her and we're given a choice keep mashing and kill her or stop and let her live allowing the player to choose whether or not to forgive Abby for killing Joel or not, if the player lets Abby live she gasps and starts crying saying she's sorry that she wanted to let Joel go but she couldn't, she couldn't let go of her revenge, Ellie looksat Abby and cries saying :and i can't bring myself to be like you, she see's how torn Abby is by her actions, even though Joel killed her father he did it to save the girl he thought of as a daughter he did it for love and Abby knows that and she realises all her revenge did was make someone else like her, Ellie gets up and says :go....just go take your friend and leave. Ellie walks away limping, screen changes to Ellie limping to Dana's house, dana comes out and asks what happened Ellie says :it's finished, danda carefully leads her inside while Ellie cries camera pans up to the sky playing the same guitar music Joel played for Ellie credits roll",2020-07-05T13:35:51Z,0,0

At the end of the first game, I think it was clear that there will be a reckoning for Joel. But the second game rushed it too much to push the story (and subvert expectation.) So I never felt anything for Abby before she did Joel in. So instead of liking Abby, I disliked her. Had Joel‚Äôs death come at the end of the second game, after I had a chance to like Abby, thinks MIGHT have been different. That was the story structure for the first game, that is why I liked Joel and could justified what he did, even if I did not totally agree with the forced decision.

The other thing I did not like was the ham fisted way Naughty Dog tried to make me like Abby. Seriously, when Ellie was trying to get her revenge, and then I was forced into Abby‚Äôs point of view. I hated Abby at that point, why am I been forced to like her? So my natural reaction was to dislike Abby even more.

And I will not even discuss about her unlikable Ellie has become. And the various plot armours.

The best solution for me to make the second game better is to follow Abby from beginning to end from Abby‚Äôs point of view, this might have make me like Abby and justify Abby‚Äôs decision to off Joel. Because the game would have given me time to like and empathize with Abby. I might not like it but I would have been able to understand it. Just as I did for the first game. If Naughty Dog was adamant in this storyline, they should have allowed an option at the end for players to kill or spare Abby. This way, I know I would have cooled down and might have spared her on a second play through.

So in the end, the Last of Us 2 was a failure in Revenge storytelling. It was a failure in subverting expectations. And it was a failure in making me enjoy playing it.


PS: I think that when Amy Hennig left, Naughty Dog became a shadow of itself. Deep down, I think Neil Druckman is desperate to prove that he is better than Amy and thus is destroying everything Amy set up. Then he hopes that players now only have the stuff he created and have no choice but to think that he is the better game creator. AND I think he failed horribly at that... Pity...",2020-07-05T12:29:30Z,2,23

Ellie actually drowns Abbie, Lev runs and tries to save her but it's too late. All he can do is cry over her dead body, and all Ellie can do is watch. There would probably be a flashback to Joel's death here.
The rest of the game plays out as normal, Ellie goes back home just to find out that everyone leaved her, she tries to play the guitar but can't, and now knowing that she became the monster she hated so much and lost everything for the sake of revenge, she points a handgun towards her head and just when she's about to pull the trigger... the credits roll.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-sTlYUeT8o,The Last of Us Part II - Angry Review,2020-07-02T02:32:07Z,@plr2473,"TLOU2 took the world and story of the first game and did something entirely different. But the underlying theme was the same. In the first game, it at first seems to be about the struggle for survival, but it is really about the characters struggling to hold onto their humanity in spite of the terrible decisions and actions they commit. In TLOU we understood the purpose of Joel and Ellie's journey. They were on a mission where the stakes were a cure to the infection that caused the collapse of the world. Anything they did was therefore justified, because it was another step towards saving the human race. And this was what made the ending so shocking, because Joel did the unthinkable due to his feelings for Ellie. But it kept with the the story's theme. In Joel's mind, his saving Ellie was justified, because the bond between them represented the last bit of humanity he had in the world, and he would fight for it at all costs. Whether he was driven more by weakness or love was beyond the point.

In the second game, on the surface, the characters' motives appear clear. They are driven by hate. But the main theme is not revenge. Like in TLOU, it is about retaining some shred of humanity in a cruel and unforgiving world. At the end of the game Ellie sees this in the bond between Abby and Lev at the beach. She also realizes that Lev will likely die without Abby, or go on to become another monster in their cycle of revenge--this being the person who had spoken up to save Ellie and Dina from Abby's rage in the theater. It was clear in the cut scene how Ellie was internally conflicted and about to let the two go without a fight. But Ellie's vision of a dead Joel triggered the hate still inside.

In the end, she does spare Abby though. And by doing so, Ellie beaks the cycle of hatred and stops herself from becoming a complete monster. The deeper meaning of this action is further shown in the closing scene between her and Joel. The world had become a hard place that brought out the worst in people, but not without reason. Joel did what he did, because as much as Ellie's life would've meant to the world in finding a cure, she'd already become everything to him. The brief flashback of Joel on the guitar before she let Abby go reminded her of this, and that if she was ever going to hold on to her humanity she'd have to learn to forgive not only Joel for the ugliness the world brought out of him, but others too. Ellie's failure to do this at first ultimately cost her so much, as she had gotten others killed, lost Dina, and become unable to play the guitar. It likely would have consumed her in the end. But she was fortunately able to regain her capacity to be a human again. We can also infer that she got much needed closure by finally making amends for the actions of Joel.

That is exceptional writing. Of course the story did have some plot holes in other areas, but the heart of the story is still a solid one, and stands on its own while building on what the first game laid out. But because it dared to do it differently and in a complex way, people were disappointed.",2020-07-05T11:26:02Z,5,1

Horizon Zero Dawn 2 looks like it is going to do what we all expected this shit game to do and I am so hyped for that game because I have faith the writers will never do what Neil and Naughty Dog have done to this game and they're entire studio and company. They've butchered this game 10 ways to Sunday and I know from playing Horizon Zero Dawn for over a year straight playing the story and DLC over in every single difficulty finding hundreds of collectables and reading every single one of them so I could fully understand the game for what the writers choose it to be and I feel it an insult to them to give it a 9.5 but I honestly didnt know how they could do better but the more I see and hear about the next one it seems like its going to be a 9.7 and if they do a third and add even more inovation to the gameplay as they've seem to have done with the second I don't see how I couldn't give the entire 3 games together a perfect 10/10 because the 1st was 100% flawless in almost every area a game could be flawless except the loading times which wasn't the creator's fault and will be destroyed by how fast the PS5 is going to be. 



Last of Us really isn't that good gameplay wise, it has ALOT of big bugs and dumb glitches, has crashed on me twice, the story is trash in the ways everyone else has described, the world isn't as free roam as we were told it would be, is about half as long as we were told thank fuck there is a redeeming factor. The game just isn't good. Even the worlds graphics are okay but in areas they fail dismally amd it makes me sad to see a game we've waited 7 years for to come out with all of these issues. I don't even agree with a 6/10 most have given it because I've had so many issues with the game that doesn't at all relate to the story that I don't see how anyone even gave it a 6/10. Horizon had next to no flaws where as Days Gone and the LOU2 had so many glitching and world issues it wasn't even funny. Both games together I'd give them a 7/10 Days Gone gets a 3/10 and that 3 is purely for the story-loved the story- and when not glitched out or completely broken and unplayable the hoards of freakers which were awesome to kill. LOU2 gets a 4/10 for some of the sounds, gameplay at rare times and for the fact you can kill Abby over and over on your second play through and never beat it again and come back when you deep pissy and kill her over and over many different ways.",2020-07-05T09:42:38Z,0,0

I am a PC user. So I dreamed about this title. After all I bought a used PS3, for a penny. Just to finally play it. And that was it. Perfection.
From part two, I expected twice as much, as everyone else. I don't have a PS4 and haven't played this game. But I was surprised by the divergence of ratings from reviewers and players. How is this possible?
 Reviewers focused on the technical excellence of this game, and the dark atmosphere of the total hopelessness of this universe. They even praise the swapping of characters during the game. Even the Polish weekly opinion  newspaper, writes about the uniqueness of this game in the subject of changing the approach to the character.
However, players are unhappy. And I just found out why.
I value honest and personal reviews from someone I trust. The Mass Effect 3 review looked similarly hard (and for good reasons).
In my opinion, movie, books, games reviews,  can't be objective . If it were, it would be boring. A dry list of pros and cons. No sense.
In a while, I will again (in some time) buy the ""latest PS4 Pro"" Sony console, used and for a penny, And I will play this game because I like video games.

Here's some advice, if you don't like something don't piss and moan about it like a child. As Last Of Us part 2 is an epic game, maybe not the same as the first but still a brilliantly told story.

And watch that horrible Abby sex scene it's like watching gay porn. She so buff till don't have boobs.  And so much blood and violence. I can't finish the game.

if people can't believe that after 4 years of living in a relatively safe community joel doesn't let his guard down a little bit then fine, but i think it made sense.
i agree with you that a pregnant lady going out in dangerous territory does sound insane even if it was just to go to a forward base to be a medic
yes characters get saved or unrealistically survived but that definitely never happened in the first game (survived horrible truck crash, chased by apv, fell off of a way too high bridge into water, survived impaling by rebar, didn't get killed by rapist cannibal, joel didn't get killed by fireflys when doctorman said ellie had to die). 
i don't know what the lesson of this game is supposed to be, but for me it was not that ""violence is bad"", but that empathy is important.  it sucks you couldn't empathize with abby at all when it really seems like she was more likable.  yeah maybe a bit too on the nose, but i don't think it should get this much hate.  obviously i really like the game and i disagree with this review. i think a lot of people never gave abby a chance because she killed joel.  honestly if you were in her shoes and the possible cure to the entire infection fell into your lap, and then some psycho, who killed the only doctor who also happened to be your father was out there, wouldn't you want revenge? again, i don't think it was a ""violence is bad"" message it was more of a ""change your perspective, the world sucks, maybe don't jump to conclusions"" message.",2020-07-05T08:22:39Z,1,0

She gets cornored by infected/faction and then runs into abby. They get out together. They begin to bond. On the Way back they meet Joel and travel with him. Back in Jackson abby finds out Who Joel is and kidnaps him. Ellie goes on a Hunt to find him. Ellie eventually finds abby who has been torturing joel. Then they get overrun and Joel sacrifices himself to allow ellie to escape. Ellie hunts abby down and then abby explains her reasons. They fight it out but doesnt kill each other. Ellie returns to Jackson but wont stay there because of memories. She leaves with Dina and finds the farm.. the end!,2020-07-05T08:13:28Z,0,1

Abby is a piece of shit? So is Joel and we care about him. Why can't we have a character that was impacted by Joel's questionable moral decisions in TLOU and then see the repercussions of his questionable actions from the first game. Joel is a complex character...both good and bad. So is Abby. But she's living Ellie's current story. Also whoever that guy is that compared this to PICARD is a monster. TLOU2 IS NOWHERE NEAR Picard level of bad. Jesus as I'm listening to this your talking about poor game play and lack of innovation. Fuck you man.

It starts with Ellie in her new life. Joel is not around and is not mentioned. The gamer wonders why he's not there, unsure if he's dead or not. Jackson is overtaken by Abby and her gang. Ellie's girlfriend is killed in the fight along with many other people. There is Ellie's revenge story for the main game. Having a new character Ellie loves be killed would have been more accepted than an already established character that the gamer has spent 7 years with. You can still have the great flashbacks with Joel and Ellie. With each new flashback you unravel the mystery to what happened to Joel. Then through these you find out Joel has had a breakdown struggling with the loss of his daughter, because that pain never goes away. He went off on his own as he hits a very low point. I believe playing as Abby would have also been more accepted this way. The twist at the end would be that Abby is looking for Joel because he killed her dad in the last game. But Abby was already spared and let go by Ellie at this point. Then at Ellie's lowest point, where she is about to give up on life, just before the end of the game you hear Joel from the distance calling out for Ellie. Cuts to credits. It sets up the third game and would have everyone hyped for the continuation of the story. Joel could be killed in the last game but needs to be in a respectful and heroic way that is believable to the character.",2020-07-05T07:15:43Z,7,34

I've got to say that the game was a huge let down. I've always liked Joe's reviews because I almost always tend to have the same opinions about games as he does. His review of Part 2  is spot on! Everything I had issues with throughout the game Joe and his crew did too. Awful character development, desperately being forced  to like Abbie, and the completely pointless 3rd act that destroys Ellie that accomplishes nothing and leaves Ellie with nothing was just awful.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-sTlYUeT8o,The Last of Us Part II - Angry Review,2020-07-02T02:32:07Z,@RipChordProductions,"Idea I made a year ago for the last of us 2:
3-5 hours after beginning:
So a building explodes and Ellie, realizing Joel was in said building, digs through rubble, then gives up, though Joel crawls through the wreckage and Ellie helps him. 

Some foreshadowing will happen here and there if you pay attention. Either late or mid game (or 3-5 hours before game ends) she gets ambushed by bandits who attempt to rape her. She struggles and screams to Joel for help, he proceeds to stand in place, with a horrified look on his face, like he's unable to do anything. A bandit says, ""who the hell you screaming at bitch?"" 

Ellie then comes to realization and flashbacks to a scene showing a dead Joel with one of his arms blown off, in the building wreckage, but hallucinates Joel coming out of said wreckage. 
She hallucinates other moments to sort of cope with his death. Example: certain characters being confused and looking at her weirdly when interacting with Joel. 

She then snaps out of it, grabs her switchblade to kill the bandits. She stabs the last bandit repeatedly till she then starts crying. Joel puts his hand on her shoulder.
Ellie yells at Joel saying that she ""failed him"" & Joel saying something like ""there was nothing you could do, don't blame yourself"".
They have a little chat, say their goodbyes, & as Joel gives a little chuckle, turns the other direction, and as he walks into the distance, fades into nothingness. Ellie curls into a ball a cries her eyes out for a minute, and proceeds with whatever she was doing.

Foreshadowing examples:
-If paying attention, you may realize Joel's clothes look unusually neat, despite being 25 years after the event, & being, idk, months after the explosion, I guess?
-When interacting with Joel, some characters will act confused and look at Ellie weirdly.

-Joel seemingly talks to others normally, but talks to Ellie in a calm tone of voice and hardly yells at her, like she's some child.

-in a couple levels when you separate from Joel and reach your destination, he'll get to the location first as if he seemingly warped there. Ellie eventually asks how he does that, he simply replies, ""found a shortcut"".

Something I thought of about a year ago, some stuff I thought of later on.

As a 'professional' video game critic, that's something you should never do. You need to be able to go into each and every game with an open mind.

This game is definitely flawed. I'll give you that. You addressed all of those issues, but you spent literally half of this video just screaming about Abby. It's clear that your biggest critique of this game is just that you didn't like playing as Abby. You wanted to play as Ellie/Joel, and you got butthurt when the game wouldn't let you do that. That's a totally valid expectation, but at a certain point you have to grow up and accept the story for what it is. It's actually kind of funny when you blame the writers for ""manipulating"" you into liking Abby by having all these heartfelt, humanizing scenes with her. Tell me, what makes these scenes different from the ENTIRE plot of TLOU1? The first game has SO MANY scenes of Ellie being a spunky little kid and having cute ""dad moments"" with Joel. The entirety of the DLC is just cute moments that humanize Ellie and make her feel real (reading the pun book for 15 minutes). Apparently it's 'good characterization' when it's Ellie, but it's ""maNiPULAtiON"" when it's Abby. This is where your review lost me. Based on this, it's obvious that you CHOSE not to like Abby. 

For me, Abby really was just incredibly likeable. But I'll be honest, that was the frustrating thing. I spent the whole first half of the game wanting her to choke on a dick, but by the end, I just wanted her to be happy and for her to go away with Owen and Lev. I was upset that the writers manipulated me like that. You're correct - the end of the game was so unsatisfying. Nothing was accomplished. It ends up pretty much bad for everyone. And that was the POINT. The game isn't supposed to be fun - it's supposed to be an experience; just not necessarily an enjoyable one. It really is a video game version of No Country For Old Men, which the Last of Us as a series is heavily based on. If you've never seen that film, a lot of innocent people die, and the bad guy wins. You don't come out of that movie with a smile on your face, but you come out understanding that you were just 'affected"" by something wasn't even real.

At the end of the day, a game review is a review of whether or not you had a worthwhile and engaging experience. It's a question of if these pixels on the screen ""affected"" you in any way. So Angry Joe, I think you're angry because this wasn't the experience you were hoping for, and that's what's causing you to think that the entire game - or the experience - was ""bad"" (6/10). I look at it the opposite way. The game f***ed with my head, subverted my expectations, and made me care about a character that I never thought I could care about. I was glued to the screen, anxious to see how the story would unfold, and it didn't unfold at all how I wanted it to. I felt that the game tortured me, emotionally. I didn't finish the game with a smile on my face. The game played ME, and I think that's worth more than a 6/10.",2020-07-05T05:50:54Z,3,3

They arent at war for resources or land either. There are plenty of references to the way jackson deals with engagements throughout the game.  Joel had to submit to the politics of jackson in order to gain the trust to keep elli safe. 

Hindsight however is 20/20 and most of us had spoilers so thats the tragedy of this debate.  All these subtle details get forgotten as you play the game because its long and most people dont have the energy to think about it. 

This is why the game is so divisive. Some feel the writer expects to much investment to find the story gratifying.  The world, gameplay, sound/music, and atmosphere hold water on its own.

Naughty dog went for a more real approach. Like if you were Abbie would you not want revenge either. While I loved Joel he proved to be selfish. Because of him he allowed thousands if not millions to die because of his attachment to Ellie. She wanted her immunity and her life to mean something and Joel new that. Unfortunately he ruined any chance of that happening when he destroyed the fireflies and lied to Ellie. I get he loves Ellie but that‚Äôs not what she wanted and that‚Äôs why she stopped talking to him. 

Now thats what really drives the story of this game. Her ruined relationship with Joel. The story was a story about learning to forgive. The last flashback you have of Ellie and Joel is her saying while she doesn‚Äôt forgive Joel but she would like to learn to forgive him. That‚Äôs what I think made it more painful for her when he died. Because she was learning to forgive and that‚Äôs why that was the last flashback of the game. She learned to forgive by the end of the game which is why she didn‚Äôt kill Abbie. Ellie was like Abbie. They were both avenging someone they loved. Revenge wouldn‚Äôt have changed what happened. 

Like Joel in the first game Ellie became the selfish one. She game up not just her family in Jackson but her perfect family with Deana and the baby. That‚Äôs the life they always talked about having. She gave that all up to chase revenge. Ellie now understood why Joel did what he did. 

Her last true gift from Joel is now ruined. He gave her a guitar and taught her to play. Now after her fight with Abbie she no longer has that. Because of her two amputated fingers she doesn‚Äôt even have that. She lost her father figure. She lost her safe haven. She lost her perfect home. She lost her family. Now she lost the last connection to Joel. She is now unable to play the guitar. She lost everything. For what!? Revenge. 

I loved this game. Not as much as the first but I truest enjoyed it. It was more emotional. Darker. Grittier. I started off pissed like Angry Joe but by the end of the game I was fully supporting Abbie. I understood her fight and quite frankly I would want the same.",2020-07-05T04:12:03Z,1,0

When Joel and Tommy save Abby in the beginning, they use their names when talking to each other and also introduce themselves to Abby so they show they can be trusted. Abby then has a look of ""Oh damn it's Joel""  They were getting chased by tons of infected, and had nowhere to go safely except for where Abby suggested (which they knew where it was).  They didn't kill Tommy and Ellie because Joel was the one who killed all those fireflies and also Abby's dad. But I do agree, Ellie should've just killed Abby in the end. They still could've kept the same ending where Dinna left. 6/10? I think that guy who's not named Joe in your videos over thinks things and kinda makes you over think it as well.

The problem with that though is that TWD is not a protagonist-driven narrative. Robert Kirkman has said time and time again that his story is about the world after the apocalypse, and the survivors as a collective. The Last of Us is the polar opposite, as it decided to focus on an exclusive relationship and got our hearts entangled in¬†that. There's a reason why Joel dooming society for Ellie was considered a good story point. Because TLOU devoted its time to their relationship.

So when suddenly pulling a TWD tactic on a story where that is not appropriate, the audience was bound to not take kindly to it.

In the end, I'm more concerned about Ellie flicking away and wasting perfectly good weed for Dina lol.",2020-07-05T03:01:26Z,0,1

Play as abbey first, she walks into the massacred hospital and sees her dad dead. you play through a portion of her sequence. Swap over to  joel and ellie: joel tells ellie about the cure incident she gets pissed and as you said: she runs off pissed at joel, and meets abbey, become friends thought a bonding sequence maybe they survive through an assult of zombies and clickers. they separate and ellie reconciles with joel. Swap to abbey who learns more about her father's death and learns that ellie was affiliated with joel, and ends up becoming angry and starts a hunt for joel. The Sequence of events in the city where they meet joel happen only ELLIE is with joel and vouches to save abbey. they save abbey and you swap over to ellie, while taking over ellie you escape with joel abbey and joels brother. they get back to the home joel is extremely suspecting of abbey because its fucking joel, however you as ellie vouch for her and convinces joel to trust her. ellie goes into another room to maybe make some food or something they attack joel and while ellie is making food or something because she grew friendly with abbey, she hears a ruckus going on downstairs, she runs down only to see joel getting attacked and then she's pinned down. ellie is hurt and feels betrayed. abbey, since she grew a bond with ellie decides to let her live, but knocks her out. then we get the flash backs with ellie and joel on ellie's birthday. she wakes up, beaten and hurt. She looks towards the camera after seeing all the pics and stuff with joel. She's furious. Cut to black end the game there.

Then have the scene where Joel reveals himself to Abby but he realizes why they're all pissed and only gets grazed by the shotgun blast but still enough to leave him weak. Have a segment where Joel is hunted by Abby as he desperately tries to hide while hearing about what he took from her and quite possibly the world when it comes to a cure and then being smashed in the head with the rifle. Keep the scene with Ellie watching Joel die except instead of a Golf Club make it just the end of a rifle. Have us play as Ellie for a while as she tries to find her Vengeance and sneak scenes of Abby taking care of the twins as everyone around her questions it. Maybe have a scene where Ellie finds the cult and they misguide her into believing Abby kidnapped the twins and make Ellie hate her even more than she already does, eventually Ellie sees just how wrong she was about the cult but still hates Abby's guts, have the Twins die somehow and have Abby visibly wounded, crippled or hunted down in front of Ellie, Ellie says something like ""you get one more chance, better not die here and if i see you again __"" and leaves Abby to try and survive where the game ends about the same but leaves Abby's fate a mystery.

It‚Äôs not about liking Abby over Ellie in the end it just shows that both side were the same. We ALL knew at the end of the first that Joel ended up being a bad guy and you didn‚Äôt think that that wouldn‚Äôt have an adverse effect? Would you really thank the man who was selfish to save your single life because he basically became your surrogate father and he looked at you as a daughter if you knew that you‚Äôre own life could have saved millions and the people that you love could have been saved from all the anguish if that possibility were true and that one person you trust lied to you. The fact that you wanted so much to have some happy ending and then were not given it just clearly shows how one sided you are in the story and then made your decision solid as you just didn‚Äôt care afterwards of what the narrative was trying to say. Joel screwed humanity over and yeah it‚Äôs understandable why. But did you really think that the rest of humanity would be ok with it? Were the Fireflies evil?  I feel like you missed the whole point because you‚Äôre like Joel. You just care about your needs over the needs of the many. I will admit I hated Abby and didn‚Äôt really like her story that much. But I understood Joel killed her dad who was the man that could have saved the world and basically Abby became like Joel when she killed Joel and Ellie was enraged because of the fact that she was never able to really get to forgive Joel until the end.,2020-07-04T23:26:57Z,0,0

If they had rearranged the scenes a bit, maybe we play the flashback scenes of both Abby and Ellie first, so then we know what happened after the first game and Abby's character is properly established BEFORE she kills Joel. then I can almost guarantee that people wouldn't be hating this game as much.
I also think we should have played as Ellie in the theater fight scene with Abby, it would have made so much more of an impact if we played as Ellie, but still lost to Abby, that idea of ""REveNgE BaD gUyS"" would be hammered in so much better if we played as the character that's out for revenge in the first place",2020-07-04T23:25:47Z,0,0

Just because you didn't get the story you wanted doesn't mean the story is bullshit. I loved the first 'Last of Us' and was heartbroken witnessing what happened to Joel, but that is the point. Joel's death at the start of this game and that fact that Joel and Ellie don't get a ""happy"" ending is proof of how cruel this world is. Ellie's revenge is justified at the beginning, because when see Abby as the villain. She leaves this body count in her wake and doesn't gives it time to sink in that these are people too. She alienates herself, until she sees she's killed someone who was innocent. A child that will never know the world. This haunts her and makes her question what she's done. Even when she has the happy life near the end, she's still haunted by her past. Even with the end she sees that Abby is just a reflection of herself. Someone protecting someone else and that killing her continues this cycle. As for Abby they fleshed her out. They made sure to make her a well developed character that gives us as a player this complicated feeling when we see her side of things. She has loved ones and friends she want to protect. She saw Joel as this monster that took her father away. That made her want to hunt him down and kill him, which she does, but it didn't bring her happiness. Her friends are dead because she chose revenge, because if she didn't kill Joel her friends would still be alive and Ellie wouldn't have become this broken person. Just because this game wasn't what YOU wanted, which seems to be by the sounds of things a very by the number sequel, doesn't mean it's bad. The first game wanted to make you feel good and hopeful about Joel's very selfish decision at the end, because the characters grew on you as the player. Maybe they can find peace, but that's not what this world is. The whole story of 'Last of Us 2' is just as visceral and deep as the first game, only now it doesn‚Äôt tell a story meant to make you feel good. It tells a story meant to make you feel disgusted and exhausted and horrible. You feel the same way the characters themselves feel. That is why I‚Äôm amazed that naughty dog had the balls and the talent to do it. This is the type of game that shows games as art, because it makes you feel something and art doesn't always make you feel good.",2020-07-04T22:54:18Z,0,1

1) Ellie knows Dina is pregnant and she followed Ellie just so she could help her avenge Joel, despite Dina not being very connected with him, 
2) Jesse, the soon to be father, is putting his life on the line to help, is walking around with us, despite being contrary to this hunt,
3) Tommy (Joel's brother) is risking his life hunting down Abby ALONE but because Ellie guilt tripped him,
4) Ellie was allowed by Maria (Tommy's wife) to get out of Jackson on the condition that Tommy would get home safely.

In all this situation, at some point Ellie sees a boat, and says to Jessie something like ""let's steal the boat and coninue hunting Abby and her friends"" and Jessie says no, because he is risking his life, Dina is vulnerable, we must save Tommy and go home. And how does Ellie replies??
""Tommy can take care of himself, if you want to go help him alone, go""

WHAT A FUCKING JOKE!! So the game is making this point about stopping the cycles of violence (despite the fact that we kill dozens of people) but it constantly forces Ellie to keep ging on her revenge quest when EVERYONE ELSE SHE LOVES MIGHT DIE BECAUSE OF IT!! But then at the end of the story she just STOPS: Jessie is dead, you fucked up with Dina, Tommy is borderline insane and NOW YOU STOP?

I actually got more enjoyment out of your review than I did out of the game. To be honest I still haven‚Äôt finished the game, I put it down about 2 hours after Joel was killed, it just didn‚Äôt interest me anymore. Honestly, I think that was the worse start to a game that I possibly could imagine, after the brilliance of the first game, which made me emotional about the relationship and hardships that Joel and Ellie experienced together. I don‚Äôt normally replay many games but when the remastered PS4 version came out I bought it again and again it blew me away, it truely was art at it‚Äôs finest, admittedly some of the gameplay was a bit clunky but the storyline was incredible, it was an emotional roller coaster and I loved it every bit as much the second time round. Then after waiting 7 years for Druckman to dish this crap up is an insult to the first game. But Druckman knew that after the leaks came out he decided to lie and use false advertising to deceive the fans into buying this SJW piece of crap that was made by these leftist progressive indoctrinated products of today‚Äôs education system and society is quickly becoming worse because of it. People shouldn‚Äôt be fooled by sales either, this game will undoubtedly sell millions of copies but it‚Äôs not because of the content of this game, it‚Äôs because of the content of the first game, that is what‚Äôs generating sales and that‚Äôs the reason why most people will give this game poor reviews unlike the multitude of 10‚Äôs given by the tech critics who the majority are more of those same SJW lefty indoctrinated kids of the last 20 or so years. But with that said I actually tried to go back to the game and could only stick it out for another couple of hours, which was about 7 hours in total. What I found was that without that story of father and child bonding and surviving against all the odds, of having something to fight and live for, it just didn‚Äôt seem important anymore. So that‚Äôs it for me, I will probably never finish this game especially after seeing the ending in some reviews. To me the game has lost all meaning, it‚Äôs like they (Druckman) went out of his way to alienate all the fans of the first game. I could think of a hundred reasons why I hate this game and I don‚Äôt understand any of them, I don‚Äôt understand why they would trash the legacy of what is possibly the best game ever, at least in a generation, but the one thing I have learned over the past 5 or so years is that ‚Äúsocial justice warrior‚Äôs‚Äù don‚Äôt need a reason to destroy anything, they are anarchists and live by destroying other people‚Äôs happiness. But anyway‚Äôs, I agree with Angry Joe‚Äôs review of the ‚Äúgame‚Äù though it‚Äôs more like a travesty and I‚Äôd give it about 4 out of 10 for the graphics, they are amazing but the story is trash and I wouldn‚Äôt rate it because it‚Äôs an injustice to all the people who created the first game.",2020-07-04T22:31:45Z,0,0

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-sTlYUeT8o,The Last of Us Part II - Angry Review,2020-07-02T02:32:07Z,@YoshiTheOreo,"As a person who played the first and loved it, and looked into the sex scene with Abby and Owen, that scene was very uncomfortable to watch. The first thought I had when I saw Abby talking to Owen when you have a side by side comparison between the two is how their arm mass are almost the same. As well to me how disproportional her body, head, and arms looked to me; on top of the fact of how androgynous she looks in certain shots that gives the impression that she's trans. It was like someone activated cheat codes to shrink the head. Then the execution of them making out is so forced, literally. Now I understand Owen use to like Abby back then, but ended up getting Mel pregnant. But what made that scene SO RIDICULOUSLY uncomfortable to me is the atmosphere of the scene.

The music and tone of the scene really doesn't call for them to have sexual tension, and the music accompanied with their actions puts in my head incest considering at the time I knew nothing about Abby and Owen. Why? I don't know, name any porn or sex scene where a banjo is accompanied and didn't have that southern vibe or theme to it? Like honestly take that OST with that banjo and apply that theme to any sex scene and I'll guarantee you it ruins and sets a sort of incest vibe even if you know the characters in that scene. Then compound that with the notion of Abby's body design and you feel like you're being tricked into liking women that look too manly for their design.

I have no hate for muscular women, coming from a guy who has played the Metal Gear Solid series and loves Olga and Merle. Muscular women are not the problem when it comes to Abby, it's how they handled her in a way where you expect the player to put aside all hatred for this character and understand her after they have her kill a well known character. That's like having Negan from the Walking Dead appear in the first episode when the Saviors were first name dropped. Then he proceeds to kill Abraham and Glenn in the same fashion, but at the same time stripping Rick and company of their survival skills and tactics to get caught by Negan with their pants down with no other excuse other than coincidence. Abby didn't EARN that kill. She was saved by the very target she set out to kill and then killed the man with no reflection of the actions of these two other than, ""He killed my daddy, so he has to die."" It's so inhuman that it honestly is the writer taking control of Abby to kill Joel to get the story started. 

The flashback with the museum is by far the best part of this FUCKING GAME. Let me reiterate that Naughty Dog, if you spent more time having character interactions with such impact like this one flashback, and understood where to place Abby and the killing of Joel, this game would have been 10/10; SHOULD have been 10/10. Imagine Abby actually reflecting on Joel's actions on saving her and then being egged on by the WLF and reminded why she's out there and the interactions with Joel, Ellie, and Abby. That would have been so interesting to experience, but your writers are such novices that they couldn't figure out a way for that interaction throughout the game to happen. If the message of the game is revenge is bad, then Abby should have been conflicted on killing Joel after being saved multiple times, then pushed by the memories of her dead father to kill Joel in front of Ellie then flee. Then have Ellie face the same issue, but kill Abby in front of Lev, where then Lev wants revenge on Ellie, but instead of killing her, Lev wants Ellie to face justice and be imprisoned for her actions as atonement for her sins because Lev understands killing the person is easier than letting them rot and lament on their actions. Therefore revenge bad message delivered.",2020-07-04T22:06:16Z,0,0

His videos entertain me, and I enjoy most of the content he creates. This is the only video, where I have fully disagreed with him. I believe The Last of Us Part 2 to be a beautifully crafted game. Though I will say that gameplay definitely gets repetitive in the long run, I still enjoyed the story, and the depth of both the new characters and the old. True Joel‚Äôs death could have been rushed for some of the fans, but I believe his death had a great awakening for Ellie. She is broken with a sense of guilt for Joel‚Äôs end, that she is starting to disconnect with her childhood. Her not picking up the game console, I see that as a sense of disconnect with her self. Even though Abby is a new character, I enjoyed every minute with Abby EXCEPT when she killed Joel and tried to kill Ellie. Obviously I felt hurt, but I enjoyed the twist. Games and tv shows that give me twists on characters is something that I look forward to experiencing! This is obviously a bad comparison, but I just felt like comparing a show that I have just recently watched that had me in awe: Death Note. SPOILER: L being killed by Light Yagame was a surprise to me. I didn‚Äôt expect to see the ending that was shown, as well as L (my favorite character) dying only halfway to the end. Obviously not a good comparison considering that Death Note and The Last of Us Part 2 are two different genres, but nonetheless they both surprised me with their interesting twists. The point I was trying to get at was the fact that Angry Joe was spoiled most of the plot of TLOU2 through leaks, which led him and his coworkers to have time to think of their own opinions (as well as getting upset with the plot) and having that set in mind that Naughty Dog, ‚ÄúYou done fucked it up‚Äù. Obviously I don‚Äôt see a lot of people paying attention to my comment considering I‚Äôm not even a YouTuber, but I still thought it was necessary to put my opinion out there for people to read (if they choose to do so).

Without words to describe the enormous amount of symbolism.
Ellie just can't draw Joel and Abby's eyes in her diary. Abby has the same gameplay mechanics as Joel plus her relationship with Lev is very similar to that of Ellie and Joel.
Abby feels empty because of Joel (because she has nightmares with her father just when we started playing with her, when she saves Yara and Lev dreamed of her father smiling at her and then she stopped having them, Ellie however continued to have them and they were getting worse ) That is why he saves Lev and Yara who are his enemies just as Joel was (since he could not do this with him) meaning that he wants to advance, turn the page and improve as a person by himself. When he decides not to kill Dina and Ellie does it for Lev showing us that when you want to advance the others are a support to do it in addition to that if he kills them the only remaining friend would lose Lev realizing in time the gravity of the cycle of revenge.
The same thing happens to Joel with Ellie, he changes thanks to her since your family and friends are what make you happy and therefore make the best of you, that's why he looks so different with Ellie than he was in the past, that's why he helps Abby. Because now he is happy. This shows us that there are neither good nor villains, only bad situations and therefore they are PEOPLE. Ellie decides a second time to go kill Abby ignoring Dina's pleas not to. Abby unlike Ellie when Lev told her to leave Dina and Ellie she did. So Ellie realized too late that revenge doesn't lead anywhere by being alone, however Abby doesn't.
Ellie spares Abby's life because deep down she sees Joel in her (that's why she can't actually draw their eyes in the diary she says her gaze is very important to her) symbolizing that she spares him. She remembers him just before finishing her, in addition to the fact that she is also forgiving herself for not having forgiven him for the hospital and for having a fight with him the last time she spoke to him (which is seen in her diary and in the flashbacks at the end). On the other hand, in the end Abby charges Lev in the same way that Joel does Ellie only with the difference that she does not want to kill Ellie who is intervening (showing her growth as a person) but Joel did massacre the Fireflies. In the end Ellie understands Joel's decision and what it means to lose someone. It is curious that both games are about going to look for the Fireflies to ""look for the light"", in the first for Joel and in the second for Abby and Ellie.",2020-07-04T21:30:42Z,0,0

Joel was the person that killed her father and doomed humanity by taking away the cure, So to her, seeking revenge was justified. 

Later because of her sparing Ellie, Ellie also came to be consumed by her lust for revenge and would stop at nothing to obtain it. Ellie would kill all of Abbys close personal friends, including a pregnant woman.(that details important), and her love interest Owen, also Ellie would torture and kill another ally of Abbys and kill 100s of other people that would get in her way in the process. 

While this is happening Abby is finding redemption by saving Lev and saving Lev's sister; members of the Scar faction and bitter enemies; she finds they too are in fact human, and learns to trust them going to great lengths and much personal risk of her own by hiding them from her faction and theirs alike, She did this to her own detriment and she was expunged from WLF for it, now discovering that not only was she ousted from WLF but that all of her friends are dead; she goes to confront Ellie who killed her friends.

Abby and Lev go to confront Ellie, Abby shoots and kills Jesse and injures Tommy; She fights Ellie and at a point comes out victorious with the ability to kill Dina and Ellie, Ellie appeal saying Dina is pregnant, so Abby spares both her and Ellie for the sake of Lev, walking away and ending the confrontation.

Abby shows that she's grown by not being so consumed by the need for vengeance that she spared Ellie the person that killed all of her friends. On top of that she also spares Dina who is pregnant; even tho Ellie showed no such mercy towards the pregnant woman she earlier killed. 
She comes out on top and is still able to walk away, now with Lev her only friend. 

Ellie should've been satisfied at that and moved on with her life but instead chose to abandon her new family to seek revenge on Abby, giving up everything in her blind hatred for Abby a person that's spared her twice. Ellie sets out to kill Abby, she finds Abby hanging on a stake severely malnourished having lost the muscle gains she worked so hard to keep. Ellie actually saves Abby here, and still insists on fighting her threatening to kill Lev if Abby refused. So they fight and for some reason Ellie after losing two fingers doesn't kill Abby. Even after all Ellies given up and the 100s of people Ellies killed she doesn't kill Abby.  Abby shuffles off defeated but ultimately will be okay. Meanwhile Ellie because of seeking her revenge finds that Dina has left and she's also unable to play guitar now, her only connection with Joel is gone. 

Ellie was the bad person all along. Abby while starting out the antagonist actually grew and rose above Ellie.",2020-07-04T21:30:20Z,0,0

The worst part of the game was to spend +10h as Abby to ""care"" about her and her crew. Instead I went from hate to loathing the characters, I could honestly write a whole thesis on why they ALL suck.

Fighting Tommy and Ellie was the most idiotic decision ever made. Why would you want to fight beloved character and live with the ones you hate? PATHETIC!",2020-07-04T21:05:11Z,1,6
