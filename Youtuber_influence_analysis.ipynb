    "The Pearson correlation and linear regression give a straightforward interpretation of the linear relationship between YouTuber and audience sentiment. However, ordinal logistic regression is arguably the most relevant model here, as it treats sentiment as an ordered variable, which is often more accurate for sentiment analysis. This model leverages the ordinal nature of the data, capturing the likelihood that an increase in YouTuber sentiment results in an audience sentiment that is also more positive. The high accuracy of both logistic models further supports the robustness of this approach."

    "# **Why We Added Additional Analyses (Logistic Regression and Ordinal Regression)**\n",
    "While the Pearson correlation and linear regression provided strong evidence of a linear relationship between YouTuber sentiment and audience sentiment, these models treated sentiment as a continuous variable. To fully capture the nature of sentiment data, it’s essential to consider it as categorical (positive, neutral, negative) rather than continuous. Logistic regression (multinomial or ordinal) models the probability of each discrete sentiment category in the audience based on the YouTuber’s sentiment, allowing for a more nuanced analysis of the relationship."
